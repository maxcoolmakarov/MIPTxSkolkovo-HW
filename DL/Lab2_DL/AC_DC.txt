Ridin' down the highway
Goin' to a show
Stop in all the byways
Playin' rock 'n' roll
Gettin' robbed
Gettin' stoned
Gettin' beat up
Broken boned
Gettin' had
Gettin' took
I tell you folks
It's harder than it looks

It's a long way to the top if you wanna rock 'n' roll
It's a long way to the top if you wanna rock 'n' roll
If you think it's easy doin' one night stands
Try playin' in a rock roll band
It's a long way to the top if you wanna rock 'n' roll

Hotel motel
Make you wanna cry
Lady do the hard sell
Know the reason why
Gettin' old
Gettin' grey
Gettin' ripped off
Under-paid
Gettin' sold
Second hand
That's how it goes
Playin' in a band

It's a long way to the top if you wanna rock 'n' roll
It's a long way to the top if you wanna rock 'n' roll
If you wanna be a star of stage and screen
Look out it's rough and mean

It's a long way to the top if you wanna rock 'n' roll
It's a long way to the top if you wanna rock 'n' roll
It's a long way to the top if you wanna rock 'n' roll
It's a long way to the top if you wanna rock 'n' roll

Well it's a long way
It's a long way, you should've told me
It's a long way, such a long way

My Daddy was workin' nine to five
When my Momma was havin' me
By the time I was half alive
They knew what I was gonna be
But I left school and grew my hair
They didn't understand
They wanted me to be respected as
A doctor or a lawyer man
(But I had other plans)

Gonna be a rock 'n' roll singer
Gonna be a rock 'n' roll star
Gonna be a rock 'n' roll singer
I'm gonna be a rock 'n' roll,
A rock 'n' roll star

Well I worked real hard and bought myself
A rock 'n' roll guitar
I gotta be on top some day
I wanna be a star
I can see my name in lights
And I can see the queue
I got the devil in my blood
Tellin' me what to do
(And I'm all ears)

Gonna be a rock 'n' roll singer
Gonna be a rock 'n' roll star
Gonna be a rock 'n' roll singer
I'm gonna be a rock 'n' roll,
A rock 'n' roll star
(I hear it pays well)

Well you can stick your nine to five livin'
And your collar and your tie
You can stick your moral standards
'Cause it's all a dirty lie
You can stick your golden handshake
And you can stick your silly rules
And all the other shit
That you teach to kids in school
('Cause I ain't no fool)

Gonna be a rock 'n' roll singer
I'm gonna be a rock 'n' roll star
Gonna be a rock 'n' roll singer
I'm gonna be a rock 'n' roll
A rock 'n' roll star

Gonna be a rock 'n' roll singer
Gonna be a rock 'n' roll star
Gonna be a rock 'n' roll singer
I'm gonna be a rock 'n' roll
A rock 'n' roll star
Yes I are!

She gave me the Queen
She gave me the King
She was wheelin' and dealin'
Just doin' her thing
She was holdin' a pair
But I had to try
Her Deuce was wild
But my Ace was high
But how was I to know
That she'd been dealt with before
Said she'd never had a Full House
But I should have known
From the tattoo on her left leg
And the garter on her right
She'd have the card to bring me down
If she played it right

She's got the jack, she's got the jack
She's got the jack, she's got the jack
She's got the jack, she's got the jack
She's got the jack, she's got the jack
She's got the jack, jack, jack, jack, jack, jack, jack
She's got the jack

Poker face was her name
Poker face was her nature
Poker straight was her game
If she knew she could get you
She played 'em fast
And she played 'em hard
She could close her eyes
And feel every card
But how was I to know
That she'd been shuffled before
Said she'd never had a Royal Flush
But I should have known
That all the cards were comin'
From the bottom of the pack
And if I'd known what she was dealin' out
I'd have dealt it back

She's got the jack, she's got the jack
She's got the jack, and who knows what else?
She's got the jack, yeah, yeah
She's got the jack, she's got the jack
She's got the jack, she's got the jack
She's got the jack, jack, jack, jack, jack, jack, jack

See me ride out of the sunset
On your colour TV screen

If you know what I mean
Women to the left of me
And women to the right
Ain't got no gun
Ain't got no knife
Don't you start no fight

'Cause I'm T.N.T., I'm dynamite
(T.N.T.) and I'll win the fight
(T.N.T.) I'm a power load
(T.N.T.) watch me explode

I'm dirty, mean, and mighty unclean
I'm a wanted man
Public enemy number one
Understand?
So lock up your daughter
Lock up your wife
Lock up your back door
And run for your life
The man is back in town
So don't you mess me 'round

Well I'm ever upper class high society
God's gift to ballroom notoriety
And I always fill my ballroom
The event is never small
The social pages say I've got
The biggest balls of all

I've got big balls
I've got big balls
They're such big balls
And they're dirty big balls
And he's got big balls
And she's got big balls
(But we've got the biggest balls of them all)

And my balls are always bouncing
My ballroom always full
And everybody cums and cums again
If your name is on the guest list
No one can take you higher
Everybody says I've got
Great balls of fire

I've got big balls
Oh I've got big balls
And they're such big balls
Dirty big balls
And he's got big balls
And she's got big balls
(But we've got the biggest balls of them all)

Some balls are held for charity
And some for fancy dress
But when they're held for pleasure
They're the balls that I like best
My balls are always bouncing
To the left and to the right
It's my belief that my big balls
Should be held every night

We've got big balls
We've got big balls
We've got big balls
Dirty big balls
He's got big balls
She's got big balls
(But we've got the biggest balls of them all)

The following is a true story
Only the names have been changed
To protect the guilty

Well I left my job in my home town
And I headed for the smoke
Got a rock 'n' roll band and a fast right hand
Gonna get to the top
Nothing's gonna stop us, no nothing

So if you've got the money, we've got the sound
You put it up and we'll put it down
If you've got the dollar, we've got the song
Just wanna boogie woogie all night long
Yeah boogie

I got holes in my shoes
I got holes in my teeth
I got holes in my socks
I can't get no sleep
I'm trying to make a million

And I got patches on the patches
On my old blue jeans
Well they used to be blue
When they used to be new
When they used to be clean

But I've got a Mumma who's a hummer
Just keeping me alive
While I'm in the band doing drinking with the boys
She's working 9 to 5
She knows her place that woman

Just you wait
One of these days see me driving round town
In my Rock 'n' Rolls Royce with the sun roof down
My bottle of booze, no summer time blues
Shouting out, "Look at me"
In my rock 'n' roll voice

No it ain't no fun, yeah
Waiting round to be a millionaire
No it ain't no fun
Waiting round to be a millionaire

Do you believe me

It's another lonely evenin'
In another lonely town
But I ain't too young to worry
And I ain't too old to cry
When a woman gets me down

Got another empty bottle
And another empty bed
Ain't too young to admit it
And I'm not too old to lie
I'm just another empty head

That's why I'm lonely
I'm so lonely
But I know what I'm gonna do

I'm gonna ride on
Ride on
Ride on, standing on the edge of the road
Ride on, thumb in the air
Ride on, one of these days I'm gonna
Ride on, change my evil ways
Till then I'll just keep ridin' on

Broke another promise
And I broke another heart
But I ain't too young to realize
That I ain't too old to try
Try to get back to the start
And it's another redlight nightmare
Another redlight street
And I ain't too old to hurry
Cause I ain't too old to die
But I sure am hard to beat

But I'm lonely
Lord I'm lonely
What am I gonna do

Ride on
Ride on, got myself a one-way ticket
Ride on
Ride on, going the wrong way
Ride on, gonna change my evil ways
Ride on, one of these days
One of these days

Ride on
Ride on
I'm gonna ride on
Ride on, looking for a truck
Ride on, hmmmm
Ride on, keep on riding
Riding on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on
Ride on, gonna have myself a good time
Ride on, ohh yeah
Ride on, yeah yeah
Ride on, one of these days
Ride on, one of these days

You know it's just the way you go down
Go down, go down, go down, go down
Go down, go down, go down, go down

Mary, Mary you're the one for me
And the way you hum
Sting me like a bumble bee
I'll be round to see you 'bout
'bout half past ten
Ain't felt this good
Since I don't know when
You got the touch that I need so much
In your finger tips
I got the honey that ya love to taste
On those lovely lips
So go down
Go down, go down, go down, go down
Go down, go down, go down, go down

Baby rub it on
Ya know it's sticky and it's sweet
And it's been so long
Ain't no one else
Got a touch like you
I let you do the things to me I let no other woman do
Feels good
Feels good
Oh yeah
You do it like you should
Oh yeah
I love you so much
Make me glad I'm a man
Go down, go down, go down, go down
Go down, go down, go down, go down, go down 

Well it's a dog eat dog
Eat cat too
Frenchy eat frog
And I eat you
Business man when you make a deal
Do you know who you can trust
Do you sign your life away
Do you write your name in dust
Hey, hey, hey
Every dog has it's day
It's a dog eat dog
Dog eat dog

Dog eat dog
Read the news
Someone win
Someone lose
Up's above and downs below
And limbo's in between
Up you win
Down you lose
It's anybody's game
Hey, hey, hey
Every dog has it's day
It's a dog eat dog
Dog eat dog

And it's a eye for eye
Tooth for tooth
It's a lie
That's the truth
See the blind man on the street
Lookin' for somethin' free
Hear the kind man ask his friend
Hey, what's in it for me
Hey, hey, hey
Every dog has it's day
It's a dog eat dog
Dog eat dog

Dog eat dog, dog eat dog
Dog eat dog, dog eat dog

In the beginning
Back in nineteen fifty five
Man didn't know 'bout a rock 'n' roll show
And all that jive
The white man had the schmaltz
The black man had the blues
No one knew what they was gonna do
But Tchaikovsky had the news
He said let there be sound
There was sound
Let there be light
There was light
Let there be drums
There was drums
Let there be guitar
There was guitar
Let there be rock

And it came to pass
That rock 'n' roll was born
All across the land every rockin' band
Was blowin' up a storm
And the guitar man got famous
The business man got rich
And in every bar there was a superstar
With a seven year itch
There was fifteen million fingers
Learnin' how to play
And you could hear the fingers pickin'
And this is what they had to say
Let there be light
Sound
Drums
Guitar
Let there be rock

One night in the club called the shakin' hand
There was a 42 decibel rockin' band
And the music was good and the music was loud
And the singer turned and he said to the crowd
Let there be rock 

On the day I was born the rain fell down
There was trouble brewin' in my home town
It was the seventh day I was the seventh son
And it scared the hell out of every one
They said stop
I said go
They said fast
I said slow
They said yes
I said no
I do the bad boy boogie

Bein' a bad boy ain't that bad
I had me more dirty women than most men ever had
All you women come along with me
And I'll show how good a bad boy can be
I said right
And they said left
I said east
And they said west
I said up
And they said down
I do the bad boy boogie
All over town

I wouldn't tell you no story
Tell you no lie
I was born to love till the day I die
I just line em up
And I knock em down
And they all came a runnin' when the word got around
Just keep runnin'
I said up
They said down
They said straight
I said round
They said lost
I said found
I said free
They said bound
Bad boy boogie
Do the bad boy
Bad boy boogie
Bad boy boogie

I never smoked me no cigarettes
I never drank much booze
But I'm only a man don't ya understand
And a man can sometimes lose
You gave me somethin' I never had
Pulled me down with you
Hit me up with a big hunka love
Hope you can pull me through
I overdosed on you
I overdosed on you
Crazy but it's true
Ain't nothin' I can do
I overdosed on you

Woman you give to me
More 'n I can take
But listen honey
I don't mind
You're a habit I don't wanna break
Don't want me none of the harder stuff
Don't need it anymore
I'm in hell
And I'm sinkin' fast
And I don't need no cure
I overdosed on you
I overdosed on you
Crazy but it's true
Ain't nothin' I can do
I overdosed on you

I'm as happy as a man can be
Too far gone to save
Died of love
And plenty of
Just write on my grave
I overdosed on you
I overdosed on you
Crazy but it's true
There's nothin' I can do
I overdosed on you

On you
On you
All over you
All over you
All over
I overdosed
Overdosed
Overdosed
On you
Overdosed

Sometimes I think this woman is kinda hot
Sometimes I think this woman is sometimes not
Puts me down
Fool me around
Why she do it to me
Out for satisfaction
Any piece of action
That ain't the way it should be
She needs lovin'
Knows I'm the man
She' gotta see
Pours my beer
Licks my ear
Brings out the devil in me
Hell ain't a bad place to be

Spends my money
Drinks my booze
Stays out every night
But I got to thinkin'
Hey, just a minute
Somethin' ain't right
Disillusions and confusion
Make me wanna cry
The shame you
Playin' your games
Tellin' me those lies
Don't mind her playin' demon
As long as it's with me
If this is hell
Then let me say
It's heavenly
Hell ain't a bad place to be

Late at night
Turns down the light
Closes up on me
Opens my heart
Tears me apart
Brings out the devil in me

Hell ain't a bad place to be
I said
Hell ain't a bad place to be
Hell
Ain't a bad place to be
Hell
Ain't a bad place to be

Wanna tell you story
About woman I know
When it comes to lovin'
She steals the show
She ain't exactly pretty
Ain't exactly small
Fourt'two thirt'ninefiftysix
You could say she's got it all

Never had a woman
Never had a woman like you
Doin' all the things
Doin' all the things you do
Ain't no fairy story
Ain't no skin and bones
But you give it all you got
Weighin' in at nineteen stone
You're a whole lotta woman
A whole lotta woman
Whole lotta Rosie
Whole lotta Rosie
Whole lotta Rosie
And you're a whole lotta woman

Honey you can do it
Do it to me all night long
Only one who turn me
Only one who turn me on
All through the night time
Right around the clock
To my surprise
Rosie never stops
She was a whole lotta woman
Whole lotta woman
Whole lotta Rosie
Whole lotta Rosie
Whole lotta Rosie
A whole lotta woman

Whole lotta woman
Whole lotta woman
Whole lotta Rosie
Whole lotta Rosie
You're a whole lotta Rosie
A whole lotta woman

Whole lotta Rosie
Whole lotta woman 

They say that you play too loud
Well baby that's tough
They say that you got too much
Can't get enough
They tell you that you look a fool
Baby I'm a fool for you
They say that your mind's diseased, shaky stuff
It's a rock 'n' roll damnation
Ma's own whippin' boy
Rock 'n' roll damnation
Take a chance while you still got the choice

You say that you want respect
Honey for what
For everything that you done for me
Thanks a lot
Get up off your bended knees
You can set your mind at ease
My temperature's runnin' hot
I been waitin' all night
For a bite of what you got

It's a rock 'n' roll damnation
Ma's own whippin' boy
Rock 'n' roll damnation
Take a chance while you still got the choice

It's a hard life

Damnation, they're putting you down
Damnation, all over town
Damnation, Cause you're way outta reach
Living on the street you gotta practice what you preach
An it's a rock 'n' roll damnation
Ma's own whippin' boy
Rock 'n' roll damnation
Take a chance while you still got the choice

Damnation, you left a happy home
Damnation, To live on your own
Damnation, You wanna live in sin
It's a rock 'n' roll
Damnation, Just a bundle of joy
Damnation, you're a toy for a boy
Damnation, you got the dollars in your eye
Always chasin' that pie in the sky
Rock 'n' roll damnation

I know that it's evil
I know that it's gotta be
I know I ain't doing much
Doing nothing means a lot to me
Living on a shoestring
A fifty cent millionaire
Open to charity
Rock 'n' roll welfare
Sitting in my Cadillac
Listening to my radio
Suzy baby get on in
Tell me where she wanna go
I'm living in a nightmare
She's looking like a wet dream
I got myself a Cadillac
But I can't afford the gasoline
I got holes in my shoes
And I'm way overdue
Down payment blues

Get myself a steady job
Some responsibility
Can't even feed my cat
On social security
Hiding from the rent man
Oh it make me wanna cry
Sheriff knocking on my door
Ain't it funny how the time flies
Sitting on my sailing boat
Sipping on my champagne
Suzy baby all at sea
Say she wanna come again
Feeling like a paper cup
Floating down a storm drain
Got myself a sailing boat
But I can't afford a drop of rain
I got holes in my shoes
And I'm way overdue
Down payment blues

Down payment blues
Down payment blues
Down payment blues

I got holes in my shoes
And I'm way overdue
I got the
Down payment blues


She had the word
Had the way
The way of letting me know
She knew the game
Called the play
She hit me low
Said now you go your way
I'll go mine
And that's the start
Doctor, doctor
Ain't no cure
For the pain in my heart

Gimme a bullet to bite on, something to chew
Gimme a bullet to bite on, and I'll make believe
I'll make believe it's you

Don't need no drink
Don't need no drug
Don't need no sympathy
Sooner or later
Send me a bill
For what she's doing to me
Operator
Long distance lips
On the telephone
Come tomorrow
Come to grips
With being all alone

Gimme a bullet to bite on, something to chew
Gimme a bullet to bite on, and I'll make believe
I'll make believe it's you

A bullet to bite on
Gimme a bullet to bite on
Come on now
Gimme a bullet to bite on
Bullet to chew
I'll make believe it's you
I'll make believe it's you
Gimme a bullet to bite on
You're a bullet baby
I want a bullet to bite on

Ya see it on television every day
Hear it on the radio
It ain't humid but it sure is hot
Down in Mexico
Boss man tryin' to tell me
Beginnin' of the end
Sayin' it'll bend me
Too late my friend

Riff raff
It's good for a laugh
Riff raff
Go on and laugh yourself in half

Now I'm the kinda guy that keeps his big mouth shut
It don't bother me
Somebody kickin' me when I'm up
Leave me in misery
I never shot nobody
Don't ever carry a gun
I ain't done nothin' wrong
I'm just havin' fun

Riff raff
It's good for a laugh
Riff raff
Go on and laugh yourself in half
