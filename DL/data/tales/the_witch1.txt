A miller at a windmill near Wettin was for a long time unable to get a
mill hand, because the mill was haunted, and four workers had already died
there, one after the other. He finally hired a high-spirited boy. At
midnight the boy was shaking out the grain when a small black cat crept up
to him. A somewhat larger one followed, and the two of them grinned
sinisterly at him.
 The one said to the other, "I wish the big gray one would come."
 Soon thereafter a big gray cat arrived. As soon as it saw the boy it
jumped at his throat; but with an ax the boy skillfully struck off half
its paw, which immediately turned into half of a woman's arm. Then the
cats ran away.
 The next morning the boy waited in vain for his breakfast. He went
downstairs and asked the miller why there was nothing to eat. The miller
apologized, saying that his wife had turned deathly ill.
 "Is she perhaps missing half an arm?" asked the boy. "If so, I can lend
her one."
 And in truth one of the woman's arms was only half there, and the
severed piece fit onto the stump.
 Then it was known that she was a witch, and she was burned to death.
