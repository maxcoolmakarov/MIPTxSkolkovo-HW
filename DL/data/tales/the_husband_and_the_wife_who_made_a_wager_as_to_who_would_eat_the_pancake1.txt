A man and his wife had three pancakes. Each ate one, but not being willing to divide the third they agreed that whichever spoke first should forfeit it to the other. Soon after, thieves entered the house; but though the couple saw them neither would make an outcry. The thieves collected their booty and then, emboldened by the house owner's unaccountable silence, picked up the woman to carry her away also.   
Still the husband made no sign, but the woman could stand it no longer. "Stop, thief!" she cried, then, rebuking her husband, "What a fool you are that for the sake of a pancake you watch these thieves without a sound!"   
But the husband clapped his hands and said laughing, "Aha! wife, I win the pancake."
