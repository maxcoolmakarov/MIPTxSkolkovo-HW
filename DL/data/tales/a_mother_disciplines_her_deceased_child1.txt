In a house in Obwalden there once lived an eight or nine year old child
who was very disobedient and rebellious. The mother recognized her child's
stubbornness but could not find it in her heart to discipline him. Thus
this child lived for some time and did many bad things.
 Then he took sick and died. After the burial the child broke through
his coffin and stuck his right arm out of the grave, causing fear and
amazement among the people. The parents attempted everything to get their
child to pull his arm back, but nothing helped.
 Finally someone said to the deeply concerned parents, "You spared the
rod too much. As punishment for this, the mother must go to the grave
every day and beat the hand with a switch until he pulls it back." 
 The mother did this, and this course of action brought the desired
results.
