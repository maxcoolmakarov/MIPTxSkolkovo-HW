A young herdsman wanted to get married. Now he knew three sisters. All
were equally beautiful, and he liked them all equally well, so he could
not decide which of them he should choose as his bride. His mother noticed
this, and she said to him, "Let me give you some good advice. Invite all
three sisters to eat with you at the same time. Serve them some cheese and
pay attention to what they do with it." 
 The son followed this advice. He invited the girls to his house and
served them cheese. The first one greedily ate her piece, complete with
the rind, so that not a trace of it was left. The second one, to the
contrary, cut off the rind so thick that she wasted a lot of good cheese.
The third one neatly peeled off just the right amount of rind. 
 The herdsman told his mother what had happened with the cheese, and she
said, "Choose the third one. She will bring you luck." 
 That is what he did, and as long as he lived, he never regretted having
followed his mother's advice.
