Messer Azzolino had a storyteller whom he made tell him tales during
the long nights of winter. It happened that one night the storyteller had
a great desire to sleep, while Azzolino urged him to tell tales. 
 The storyteller began a tale of a countryman who had a hundred
byzantines [ancient coins] of his own which he took with him to the market
to buy sheep at the price of two per byzantine. Returning with his sheep
he came to a river he had passed before much swollen with the rains which
had recently fallen. Standing on the bank, he saw a poor fisherman with a
boat, but of so small a size that there was only room for the countryman
and one sheep at a time. Then the countryman began to cross over with one
sheep, and he began to row. The river was wide. He rowed and passed
over. 
 And here the storyteller ceased his tale. 
 Azzolino said, "Go on!" 
 And the storyteller replied, "Let the sheep cross over, and then I will
tell you the tale." 
 Since the sheep would not have crossed in a year, he could meanwhile
sleep at his ease.
