One of Arthur's warriors, whose name was March (or Parch) Amheirchion,
was lord of Castellmarch in Lleyn. This man had horse's ears (resembling
Midas), and lest anybody should know it, he used to kill every man he
sought to shave his beard, for fear lest he should not be able to keep the
secret; and on the spot where he was wont to bury the bodies there grew
reeds, one of which somebody cut to make a pipe.  
 The pipe would give no other sound than "March Amheirchion has horse's
ears."  
 When the warrior heard this, he would probably have killed the innocent
man on that account, if he had not himself failed to make the pipe produce
any other sound. But after hearing where the reed had grown, he made no
further effort to conceal either the murders or his ears.
