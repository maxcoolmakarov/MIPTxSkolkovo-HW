In a remote village there lived a man and his wife, who was a stupid 
little woman and believed everything that was told 
her. Whenever people wanted anything from her they used to come and 
flatter her; but this had to be done in the absence of 
her husband, because he was a very miserly man, and would never part with 
any of his money, for all he was exceedingly 
rich.   
Nevertheless, without his knowledge cunning beggars would now and 
then come to his wife and beg of her, and they 
used generally to succeed, as she was so amenable to flattery. But 
whenever her husband found her out he would come 
down heavily upon her, sometimes with words and sometimes with blows. Thus 
quarrels arose, until at last, for the sake of 
peace, the wife had to give up her charitable propensities. 
 Now there lived in the village a rogue of the first water, who had many 
a time witnessed what took place in the rich 
miser's family. Wishing to revive his old habit of getting what he wanted 
from the miser's wife he watched his opportunity and 
one day, when the miser had gone out on horseback to inspect his land, he 
came to his wife in the middle of the day and fell 
down at the threshold as if overcome by exhaustion. She ran up to him at 
once and asked him who he was. 
 "I am a native of Kailâsa," said he, "sent down by an old couple 
living there, for news of their son and his wife." 
 "Who are those fortunate dwellers on Shiva's mountain?" said she. 
 On this the rogue gave the names of her husband's deceased parents, 
which he had taken good care, of course, to learn from the neighbors. 
 "Do you really come from them?" said she. "Are they doing well there? 
Dear old people. How glad my husband would 
be to see you, were he here! Sit down please, and take rest awhile until 
he returns. How do they live there? Have they 
enough to eat and to dress themselves?" 
 These and a thousand other questions she put to the rogue, who, for his 
part, wanted to get away as quick as possible, 
as he knew full well how he would be treated if the miser should return 
while he was there, so he said, "Mother, language 
has no words to describe the miseries they are undergoing in the other 
world. They have not a rag to cover themselves, and 
for the last six days they have eaten nothing, and have lived on water 
only. It would break your heart to see them." 
 The rogue's pathetic words fully deceived the good woman, who firmly 
believed that he had come down from 
Kailâsa, sent by the old couple to her. 
 "Why should they suffer so?" said she, "when their son has plenty to 
eat and to dress himself, and when their 
daughter-in-law wears all sorts of costly ornaments?" 
 With that she went into the house and came out with two boxes 
containing all the clothes of herself and her husband, 
and gave the whole lot to the rogue, with instructions to take them to her 
poor old people in Kailâsa. She also gave 
him her jewel box for her mother-in-law. 
 "But dress and jewels will not fill their hungry stomachs," said 
he. 
 Requesting him to wait a little, the silly woman brought out her 
husband's cash chest and emptied the contents into the 
rogue's coat, who now went off in haste, promising to give everything to 
the good people in Kailâsa. Our good lady in 
accordance with etiquette, conducted him a few hundred yards along the 
road and sent news of herself through him to her 
relatives, and then returned home. The rogue now tied up all his booty in 
his coat and ran in haste towards the river and crossed over it. 
 No sooner had our heroine reached home than her husband returned after 
his inspection of his lands. Her pleasure at 
what she had done was so great, that she met him at the door and told him 
all about the arrival of the messenger from 
Kailâsa, and how she had sent clothes, and jewels, and money through 
him to her husband's parents.   
The anger of her 
husband knew no bounds. But he checked himself for a while, and asked her 
which road the messenger from Kailâsa 
had taken, as he said he wanted to follow him and send some more news to 
his parents. To this she willingly agreed and 
pointed out the direction the rogue had gone.   
With rage in his heart at 
the trick played upon his stupid wife, our hero rode on 
in hot haste, and after a ride of two  ghatikâs  he caught 
sight of the departing rogue, who, finding escape 
hopeless, climbed up into a big  pîpal  tree. Our hero soon 
reached the bottom of the tree and shouted to the 
rogue to come down. 
 "No, I cannot, this is the way to Kailâsa," said the rogue, and 
climbed up on the top of the tree. 
 Seeing no chance of the rogue's coming down, and as there was no third 
person present to whom he could call for help, 
our hero tied his horse to an adjacent tree and began climbing up the 
 pîpal  tree himself.   
The rogue thanked all 
his gods when he saw this, and waited until his enemy had climbed nearly 
up to him, and then, throwing down his bundle of 
booty, leapt quickly from branch to branch until he reached the bottom. He 
then got upon his enemy's horse, and with his 
bundle rode into a dense forest in which no one was likely to find 
him. 
 Our hero being much older in years was no match for the rogue. So he 
slowly came down, and cursing his stupidity in 
having risked his horse to recover his property, returned home at his 
leisure.   
His wife, who was waiting his arrival, welcomed 
him with a cheerful countenance and said, "I thought as much, you have 
sent away your horse to Kailâsa to be used 
by your father." 
 Vexed as he was at his wife's words, our hero replied in the 
affirmative to conceal his own stupidity. 
 Thus, some there are in this world, who, though they may not willingly 
give away anything, pretend to have done so 
when, by accident, or stupidity, they happen to lose it.
