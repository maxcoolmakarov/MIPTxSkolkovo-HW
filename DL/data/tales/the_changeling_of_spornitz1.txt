Legends, Tales, and Customs from Mecklenburg   
A young peasant woman in Spornitz had her child stolen by an underground 
person or a Mönk, and a changeling put in its place in the cradle.  
The mother saw it happen, but she could neither move nor call out.  The 
maniken told her that her son would someday become the king of the 
underground people.  From time to time they had to exchange one of their 
king's children for a human child so that earthly beauty would not 
entirely die out among them.  She was told to take good care of the 
little dwarf prince, and her house would be blessed with good fortune.  
With that the Mönk laid the changeling on her breast and disappeared 
with her child.  She took care of the child, and the prosperity of her 
household increased visibly.  However, the changeling remained small and 
ugly, and died in his twentieth year.
