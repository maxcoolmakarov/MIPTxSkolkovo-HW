Nasreddin Hodja had grown old and was near death. His two grieving 
wives, knowing that his end was near, were dressed in mourning robes and 
veils.  
 "What is this?" he said, seeing their sorrowful appearance. "Put aside 
your veils. Wash your faces. Comb your hair. Make yourselves beautiful. 
Put on your most festive apparel."  
 "How could we do that?" asked the older of his wives, "with our dear 
husband on his deathbed?"  
 With a wry smile he replied, speaking more to himself than to them, 
"Perhaps when the Angel of Death makes his entry he will see the two of 
you, all decked out like young brides, and will take one of you instead of 
me."  
 With these final words he laughed quietly to himself, happily closed 
his eyes, and died.
