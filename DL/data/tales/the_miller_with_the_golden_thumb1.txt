A merchant that thought to deride a miller sitting among company said
to him, "Sir, I have heard that every honest miller that tells the truth
has a golden thumb." 
 The miller answered and said it was true. 
 Then the merchant said, "I pray, let me see your thumb." And when the
miller showed his thumb, the merchant said, "I cannot perceive that your
thumb is gold. It is the same as other men's thumbs." 
 The miller answered, and said, "Sir, the truth is that my thumb is
gold, but you have no power to see it, for it has the property that he who
is a cuckold shall never have power to see it."
