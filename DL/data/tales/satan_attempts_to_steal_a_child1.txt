Folk Legends, Customs, and Beliefs from Tyrol 
 
In the Sarn Valley there lived a farmer's wife who did not take 
Christianity all too seriously.  She failed to bless her children morning 
and night.  Nor was she good to people in other regards.  She quarreled 
with the servants, and no one did well enough to please her.
  
One evening she scolded the entire household and sent the children the 
bed without giving them a blessing or having them say their prayers.  
Suddenly the devil stood in the middle of the room, ripped the youngest 
child from its bed and was about to carry it away.  He was already at the 
hole in the wall though which he had entered when the farmer's wife saw 
him.  She was terrified, but fortunately it occurred to her to make the 
sign of the cross above the child.  Seeing this, the devil dropped the 
child to the floor and fled screaming back out through the hole.
  
That was a good lesson for the woman.  She changed her ways and became 
pious and patient, and she also had her children say their prayers.  
Never again did she allow one of them to get up or go to bed without 
receiving her blessing.  However, no one was ever able to plaster shut 
the hole that the devil had made in the wall in order to enter the house.
