How Vulcan once espied his wife 
Engaged with Mars in amorous strife. 
When cunningly he threw a snare 
Around the fond but guilty pair. 
 
 
Whene'er Dan Vulcan, dunderhead,    
Had spied the amorous twain in bed,    
Around the couch a net he threw    
(Which was an foolish thing to do;   
  
For little wotteth he of life    
Who thinks he only hath his wife),    
And then the gods did he convoke,    
Who crowded round with gibe and joke,    
Beholding how the pair were ta'en.    
But many 'mong the host, with pain,    
Beheld dame Venus' sore distress,    
While marveling at her loveliness;   
  
Nor heard unmoved her bitter cries    
At suffering such indignities    
Before her peers in open day.    
Yet 'twas no marvel, one would say,    
That Venus unto Mars should give men    
Herself -- for could she care to live    
With Vulcan, black from head to foot,    
Hands, face, and throat begrimed with soot?   
  
Such things in Venus' breast must rouse    
Disgust, though Vulcan were her spouse.    
Nay, even though she had been paired    
With Absalom the golden-haired,   
  
Or lovely Paris, Priam's son,    
She scarce had been content with one,    
For ever would that beauteous queen    
Do what all women love I ween.    
Women as free as men are born;    
It is the law alone hath torn    
Their charter, and that freedom riven    
From out their hands by Nature given.   
  
For Nature is not such a fool    
As order, by unbending rule,    
Margot to keep to Robichon,    
Nor yet for him the only one    
To be Marie or fair Perrette,    
Jane, Agnes, or sweet Mariette,   
  
But as, dear son, I scarce need teach,    
Made each for all and all for each,    
And every one for all alike,    
E'en as the taste and fancy strike.   
  
So that (although by marriage law    
They are assigned like things of straw),    
To satisfy Dame Nature's call,    
To which they hearken one and all,    
And strifes and murders to avoid,    
Whereto they well might be decoyed,    
Ever have women, foul or fair,    
Whether the name of maid they bear,    
Or wife, done all within their power    
To win back freedom as their dower;   
  
Though at great hazards they maintain    
Their rights, and evils thick as rain    
Have happed both now and formerly.    
Ten, nay, a hundred easily,    
Could I of instances set forth;    
But let them pass as nowise worth    
My pains to tell or yours to hear,    
You'd weary ere the end came near.    
...    
Therefore, dear son, should we be slow    
Venus and Mars to blame, I trow.    
And though the Gods in mockery laughed    
To see the pair by Vulcan's craft    
Ensnared, yet many a one full fain    
Had been, could he the place have ta'en    
Of Mars, in Venus' fond embrace,    
While Vulcan, mad with his disgrace,    
Two thousand marks had rather given    
Than cuckold stand before high heaven.     
The pair he thus exposed to shame,    
Reckless of scorn henceforth became,    
And boldly practiced that which they    
Strove erst to hide from light of day,    
Shame and decorum cast aside.    
And then the Gods told far and wide    
The tale, till all through heaven 'twas known,    
From mouth to mouth mid laughter thrown.     
And Vulcan stormed with rage to think    
The draught he brewed he needs must drink,    
Since for his folly naught could he    
Find balsam, salve, or remedy.    
Rather than trap the twain, indeed,     
'Twere wiser to have given no heed,    
But silently resolve in mind    
To be to Venus' failings blind,    
So long as she towards him behaved    
With kindness, granting all he craved.    
From this, let no man e'er forget    
That grievous folly 'tis to set    
A trap whereby a wife may be    
Convicted of inconstancy;     
For if she find her thus exposed,    
The door of virtue feels she closed    
Behind her, and the unhappy wretch,    
Whom evil-eyed suspicions stretch    
Upon the rack, when he hath caught    
His wife, shall ne'er again know aught    
Of peace or happiness, but die    
The prey of cruel Jealousy.
