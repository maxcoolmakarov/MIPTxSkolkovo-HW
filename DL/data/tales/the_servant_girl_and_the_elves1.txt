Once upon a time there was a poor servant girl who was diligent and
neat. Every day she swept out the house and shook the sweepings onto a
large pile outside the door. One morning just as she was beginning her
work she found a letter on the pile of sweepings. She could not read, so
she stood her broom in the corner and took the letter to her employers. It
was an invitation from the elves, asking the girl to serve as godparent at
the baptism of one of their children. 
 At first the girl did not know what she should do, but finally they
convinced her to accept. It would not be right, they said, to decline such
an invitation. 
 Three elves came and led her to a hollow mountain where the little
people lived. Everything there was small, but more ornate and splendid
than can be described. The new mother was lying in a bed of ebony
decorated with pearl buttons. The covers were embroidered with gold. The
cradle was made of ivory, and the bathtub of gold. The girl stood in as
godparent, and then wanted to go back home, but the elves asked her
fervently to stay with them for three days. She agreed to do so, and the
time passed with pleasure and joy. The little people did everything to
make her happy. 
 Finally she wanted to return home. They filled her pockets with gold
and led her outside the mountain. She arrived home. Wanting to begin her
work, she picked up the broom that was still standing in the corner and
started to sweep. Then some strange people came out of the house and asked
her who she was and what she was doing there. It was not three days, as
she thought, that she had spent in the mountain with the little men, but
rather seven years. In the meantime her former employers had died.
