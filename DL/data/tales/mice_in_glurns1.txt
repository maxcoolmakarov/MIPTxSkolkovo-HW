In the vicinity of Glurns there is an ancient legend about mice that came to the Vinschgau district and were eating the peasants out of house and home. It is said that a traveling student then came and with an incantation ordered all the mice -- numbering in the millions -- into the valley and forced them to leave.  
The mice stood at attention and then marched in orderly columns, as in the military, out of the Vinschgau district. They rested for a few days and then disappeared altogether.  
Unfortunately the sorcerer disappeared with them, so the thankful inhabitants could not pay him the expected reward. No one knows the incantation, and in any event the entire legend is confused and mysterious. This may well result from the fact that it is told and retold in the village taverns, of which there are many in the countryside.
