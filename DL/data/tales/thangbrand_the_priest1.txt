SHORT of stature, large of limb, 
Burly face and russet beard, 
All the women stared at him, 
When in Iceland he appeared. 
"Look!" they said, 
With nodding head, 
"There goes Thangbrand, Olaf's Priest." 
All the prayers he knew by rote, 
He could preach like Chrysostome, 
From the Fathers he could quote, 
He had even been at Rome. 
A learned clerk, 
A man of mark, 
Was this Thangbrand, Olaf's Priest. 
He was quarrelsome and loud, 
And impatient of control, 
Boisterous in the market crowd, 
Boisterous at the wassail-bowl, 
Everywhere 
Would drink and swear, 
Swaggering Thangbrand, Olaf's Priest. 
In his house this malcontent 
Could the King no longer bear, 
So to Iceland he was sent 
To convert the heathen there, 
And away 
One summer day 
Sailed this Thangbrand, Olaf's Priest. 
There in Iceland, o'er their books 
Pored the people day and night, 
But he did not like their looks, 
Nor the songs they used to write.  
All this rhyme 
Is waste of time! " 
Grumbled Thangbrand, Olaf's Priest. 
To the alehouse, where he sat, 
Came the Scalds and Saga men; 
Is it to be wondered at, 
That they quarrelled now and then, 
When o'er his beer 
Began to leer 
Drunken Thangbrand, Olaf's Priest? 
All the folk in Altafiord 
Boasted of their island grand; 
Saying in a single word, 
"Iceland is the finest land 
That the sun 
Doth shine upon!" 
Loud laughed Thangbrand, Olaf's Priest. 
And he answered: "What's the use 
Of this bragging up and down, 
When three women and one goose 
Make a market in your town! " 
Every Scald 
Satires scrawled 
On poor Thangbrand, Olaf's Priest. 
Something worse they did than that! 
And what vexed him most of all 
Was a figure in shovel hat, 
Drawn in charcoal on the wall; 
With words that go 
Sprawling below, 
"This is Thangbrand, Olaf's Priest." 
Hardly knowing what he did, 
Then he smote them might and main, 
Thorvald Veile and Veterlid 
Lay there in the alehouse slain. 
"To-day we are gold, 
To-morrow mould!" 
Muttered Thangbrand, Olaf's Priest 
Much in fear of axe and rope, 
Back to Norway sailed he then. 
"O, King Olaf! little hope 
Is there of these Iceland men!" 
Meekly said, 
With bending head, 
Pious Thangbrand, Olaf's Priest.
