Once the plague broke out in Rankendorf and Grevenstein near Dassow. This is how it happened:  
One evening at the Grevenstein mill a journeyman and an apprentice were busy grinding flour to be taken to Pohnsdorf the next day. After dark the apprentice stuck his head out the door and heard the howling of dogs.  
"Listen," he called to the journeyman. "Mother Gauerken is coming with her dogs."  
The journeyman ran to the door and saw a raven-black cloud slowly descending over Pohnsdorf, and from the cloud he heard the cry: "Oh, Pohnsdorf, it's coming to you."  
The journeyman thought that because the people of Pohnsdorf had him grind their grain he did not want any evil to befall them.  
Therefore he called out to the cloud: "Hey! Just make your way toward Rankendorf and Grevenstein."  
Then the cloud burst apart, one part descending on Rankendorf and the other on Grevenstein. The next day the plague broke out in both places.  
The apprentice told everyone what had happened. The journeyman was captured and was to be burned at the stake. However, Mother Gauerken took pity on him, and the plague suddenly ceased. For joy they spared the journeyman's life.
