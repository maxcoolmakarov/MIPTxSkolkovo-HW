Limerick 
  
I heard of a man from Mayo went to Limerick, and walked two or three times 
across the bridge there. And a cobbler that was sitting on the bridge took 
notice of him, and knew by the look of him and by the clothes he wore that 
he was from Mayo, and asked him what was he looking for. And he said he 
had a dream that under the bridge of Limerick he'd find treasure.   
"Well," says the cobbler, "I had a dream myself about finding treasure, 
but in another sort of a place than this." And he described the place 
where he dreamed it was, and where was that, but in the Mayo man's own 
garden.   
So he went home again, and sure enough, there he found a pot of gold with 
no end of riches in it. But I never heard that the cobbler found anything 
under the bridge at Limerick.
