Sometimes it is a brother, instead of a father, from whom the heroine is forced to flee. Thus in the story of  Kniaz Danila Govorila , Prince Daniel the Talker is bent upon marrying his sister, pleading the excuse so often given in stories on this theme, namely, that she is the only maiden whose finger will fit the magic ring which is to indicate to him his destined wife. 
 
While she is weeping "like a river," some old women of the mendicant-pilgrim class come to her rescue, telling her to make four  Kukolki , or small puppets, and to place one of them in each corner of her room. She does as they tell her. The wedding day arrives, the marriage service is performed in the church, and then the bride hastens back to the room. 
 
When she is called for -- says the story -- the puppets in the four corners begin to coo: 

  
Kuku! Prince Danila!  
Kuku! Govorila!   
Kuku! He wants to marry,  
Kuku! His own sister.  
Kuku! Split open, O Earth!  
Kuku! Sister, disappear! 
 
 
The earth opens, and the girl slowly sinks into it. Twice again the puppets sing their song, and at the end of its third performance, the earth closes over the head of the rescued bride. Presently in rushes the irritated bridegroom. "No bride is to be seen; only in the corners sit the puppets, singing away to themselves." He flies into a passion, seizes a hatchet, chops off their heads, and flings them into the fire.
