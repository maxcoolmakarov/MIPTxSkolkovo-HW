There was a poor young woman that had brought her self e'en to death's door with grief for her sick husband, but the good man, her father, did all he could to comfort her.  
"Come, child," says he. "We are all mortal: Pluck up a good heart, my girl; for the worst come to the worst, I have a better husband in store for the, when this is gone."  
"Alas, sir," says she, "what d'ye talk of lanother husband for? Why you had as good have struck a dagger to my heart. No, no. If ever I think of another husband may -------"  
Without more ado the man dies, and the woman immediately breaks out into such transports of tearing her hair and beating her breast that every body thought she'd have run stark-mad upon't.  
But upon second thoughts she wipes her eyes, lifts 'em up, and cries, "Heaven's will be done." And then turns to her father. "Pray, sir," says she, "about t'other husband you were speaking of: Is he here in the house?"  
The Moral: 
This fable gives us to understand that a widow's tears are quickly dry'd up, and that it is not impossible for a woman to out-live the death of her husband. And after all the outrages of her funeral sorrow, to propose to her self many a merry hour in the arms of a second spouse.
