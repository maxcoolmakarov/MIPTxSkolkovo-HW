The following note refers to the tale above  Searching for the Kingdom of the Green Mountains .   
This is a very wide-spread incident, but, as the following extract from a letter of Dr. Hyde's will show, it is by no means necessary to assume borrowing to account for its appearance at different times and in different lands. 
 
Curiously enough, I met a doctor from County Sligo the very day before I received your proofs of this story, and he told me he had seen a very old man putting scraws (divots) on a house, and he said to him, "How old are you?' and the man said, "Ninety-six."  
"You're a great old man to be working like that," said the doctor.  
"No, but if you were to see my father, you'd say he was the great old man."  
The father came out, apparently as hale and hearty as the son, and he was 115 years old. I mention this as a curious coincidence, for next day I read your story.
