The wolves sent a deputation to the sheep with proposals for a lasting 
peace between them, on condition of their 

giving up the sheepdogs to instant death. The foolish sheep agreed to the

brought him wisdom, interfered and said, "How can we expect to live at 
peace with you? Why, even with the dogs at hand 

to protect us, we are never secure from your murderous attacks!"
