In Denmark there is an ancient castle by the name of Kronborg.  It stands
very close to the Ã˜resund, where hundreds of great ships pass every
day, ships from England, from Russia, and from Prussia.  They greet the
ancient castle with canon salutes:  "Boom!"  And the castle salutes back
with its canons:  "Boom!"  That is how canons say "Good day!" and "Thank
you!" 
 
The ships don't sail there during the winter, for then everything is
frozen solid all the way to the Swedish coast, it is just like a country
road.  The Danish flag and the Swedish flag are waving there, and the
Danes and the Swedes say "Good day!" and "Thank you!" to each other, but
not with canons, but rather with a friendly handshake.  They take wheat
bread and pretzels home with them, because foreign food always tastes
better.  But the grandest thing to be seen there is the ancient Kronborg.
And down deep inside, in a dark cellar where no one ever goes, sits Holger
Danske.  He is dressed in iron and steel, with his head resting on his
strong arms.  His long beard hangs over a marble table, into which it has
grown.  The knight sleeps and dreams, and in his dreams he sees everything
that is happening above in Denmark.  
Every Christmas Eve an Angel of God
comes and assures him that what he has dreamed is true, and that he can
safely go back to sleep, because Denmark is in no real danger.  But if
danger ever does come, then old Holger Danske will arise, breaking the
table in pieces as he pulls out his beard!  And then he will come forward
and strike out and be heard in all the lands of the earth.
