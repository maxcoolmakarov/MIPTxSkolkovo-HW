Once upon a time a poor farmer and his wife, having finished their
day's labor and eaten their frugal supper, were sitting by the fire, when
a dispute arose between them as to who should shut the door, which had
been blown open by a gust of wind. 
 "Wife, shut the door!" said the man. 
 "Husband, shut it yourself!" said the woman. 
 "I will not shut it, and you shall not shut it," said the husband; "but
let the one who speaks the first word shut it." 
 This proposal pleased the wife exceedingly, and so the old couple, well
satisfied, retired in silence to bed. 
 In the middle of the night they heard a noise, and, peering out, they
perceived that a wild dog had entered the room, and that he was busy
devouring their little store of food. Not a word, however, would either of
these silly people utter, and the dog, having sniffed at everything, and
having eaten as much as he wanted, went out of the house. 
 The next morning the woman took some grain to the house of a neighbor
in order to have it ground into flour. 
 In her absence the barber entered, and said to the husband, "How is it
you are sitting here all alone?" 
 The farmer answered never a word. The barber then shaved his head, but
still he did not speak; then he shaved off half his beard and half his
mustache, but even then the man refrained from uttering a syllable. Then
the barber covered him all over with a hideous coating of lampblack, but
the stolid farmer remained as dumb as a mute. "The man is bewitched!"
cried the barber, and he hastily quitted the house. 
 He had hardly gone when the wife returned from the mill. She, seeing
her husband in such a ghastly plight, began to tremble, and exclaimed,
"Ah! wretch, what have you been doing?" 
 "You spoke the first word," said the farmer, "so begone, woman, and
shut the door."
