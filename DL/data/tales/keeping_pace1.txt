Once upon a time there was a fox and a lion. They were going to have a 
race. The lion said that he could beat all the fox racin'. The fox said 
that he couldn't beat him racin'. So they got under the mark. They both 
started out the same time. The lion was runnin' so fast that the fox 
couldn't keep up with him. So he jumped on the lion back. And when they 
got to the place, the fox was there too. So that the way it ended out.
