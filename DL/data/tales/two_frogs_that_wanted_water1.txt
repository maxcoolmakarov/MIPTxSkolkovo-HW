Upon the drying up of a lake, two frogs were forc'd to quit, and to seek for water elsewhere. As they were upon the search, they discover'd a very deep well.  
Come (says one to t'other), let us e'en go down here, without looking any further.  
You say well, says her companion, but what if the water should fail us here too? How shall we get out again?  
 The Moral: 
'Tis good advice to look before we leape.
