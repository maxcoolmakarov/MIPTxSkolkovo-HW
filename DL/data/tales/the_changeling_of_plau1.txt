Legends, Tales, and Customs from Mecklenburg   
A married couple in Plau had a child that after two years was still only 
as long as a shoe.  It had an enormously large head and could not learn 
to talk.  They shared their concern with an old man, who said: "For sure 
the underground people have exchanged your child.  If you want to be 
certain about this, then take an empty eggshell and in the presence of 
the child pour fresh beer into it, then add yeast to make it ferment.  If 
the child then starts to talk, then my suspicion is right."  They 
followed this advice.  The beer had scarcely begun to ferment when the 
child called out from its cradle:
 
 
Now I am as old  
As Bohemian gold,  
But this is the first I've ever heard tell,  
Of beer being brewed in an eggshell.
 
 
The parents determined that the very next night they would throw the 
child into the Elbe River.  They arose after midnight and went to the 
cradle, where they discovered a strong and healthy child.  The 
underground people had taken back their own child.
