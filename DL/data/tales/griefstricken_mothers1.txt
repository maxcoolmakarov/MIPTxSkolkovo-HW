In Guben a child of Frau P. died, and she cried excessively. Then the
child came to her and said, "Mother, do not cry so much. I am deep in
water. If you cry any more, I will drown." 
 
 One evening another woman from the same town who had also cried
excessively for her child placed the water cans upside down in the hallway
of her house. The next morning she found them right side up behind the
door. Then she thought, "That must mean something. I had better not cry so
much, or the water cans will soon be filled with tears."
