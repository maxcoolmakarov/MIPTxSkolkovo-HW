In ancient times a fiery dragon came to the area above the village of 
Ebringen and disappeared into a cave on the southern slope of 
Schönberg Mountain. The heathen population revered the dragon as a 
god, to whom from time to time a human sacrifice had to be presented for 
its nourishment. Finally the lot fell on the charming and youthful 
daughter of the prince who resided at Schneeburg Castle. 
 At the same time there lived at the foot of Schönberg Mountain a 
young knight who had secretly converted to Christianity. When he learned 
of the horrible fate awaiting the prince's daughter he bravely resolved to 
kill the all-powerful dragon. Well armored and with a mighty spear in his 
right hand, he mounted his valiant steed and, trusting in his god, he 
advanced toward the hellish beast. 
 Greedily awaiting the fearlessly advancing attacker, the monster lay 
before his cave, his jaws opened and fuming with poison. The proud and 
foaming steed reared up, but powerful arms swiftly and surely held the 
reigns and aimed the spear. Hissing, the death-delivering projectile flew 
into monster's open throat. 
 The prince and the people received the news of the young knight's brave 
and liberating deed with jubilation. And with jubilation they praised the 
battle god who had granted such great power to the warrior. To commemorate 
the deed, stone crosses were erected on the houses in Ebringen, above 
which the dragon had formerly flown. Some of these stone crosses still 
exist on gables in the village. The daring knight, whose name was George, 
was now revered as a saint, and thus the place where he lived was later 
called Saint George. 
 Until a short time ago, an annual festival was held there every April 
23, the saint's day, and peasants from the region would ride their horses 
around the church three times, asking Saint George's protection for their 
horses.
