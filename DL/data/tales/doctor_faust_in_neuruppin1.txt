It is said that Doctor Faust also once lived in Neu-Ruppin. They say that in the evening he usually played cards with some of the residents, and that he won a lot. One evening one of the players dropped a card beneath the table, and when he picked it up he saw that the doctor had horse-feet. With that it became evident why he always won so much.  
Long after his death he could often be seen in a thicket on the lake shore sitting at a table with a number of people and playing cards. That is where he continues to practice his art.
