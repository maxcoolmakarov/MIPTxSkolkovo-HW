One time a colored man an' a white man out hick'ry-nut huntin'. Found big hick'ry nut an' small walnut. Lay 'em up on de gatepost.   
Go into de graveyard. Say, "We'll divide what we got. You take this one, an' I'll take the other."   
They divided all dey had in de graveyard. Then said, "We'll go up to de gate-pos' an' divide. You take the black, an' I'll take the white."   
Man on outside goin' along, an' he heard 'em talkin'. An' he become frighten. An' he went back to his neighbor's house where there was an ol' man had the rheumatism. An' he said, "You go with me. I'll tote you."   
Goes on with him, an' he says, "Jesus Christ an' the Devil is up there dividin' up the dead."   
An' when they got along near the gate-post says, "You take the black one, an' I'll take the white one."   
So he throws this white man down, an' he run off. An' the ol' man beat him back home.
