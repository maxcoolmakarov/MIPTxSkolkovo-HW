The first Indians were on the other side of the ocean, and Old Man 
decided to lead them to a better place. So he brought them over the ice to 
the far north. When they were crossing the ice, the Sarcee were in the 
middle and there was a boy riding on a dog travois. As they were going 
along, this boy saw a horn of some animal sticking up through the ice. Now 
the boy wanted this horn, and began to cry. So his mother took an ax and 
cut it off. As she did so, the ice gave way, and only those on this side 
of the place where the horn was will ever get here. 
 Now Old Man led these people down to where the Blood Reserve now is, 
and told them that this would be a fine country for them, and that they 
would be very rich.  
 He said, "I will get all the people here."  
 All the people living there ate and lived like wild animals; but Old 
Man went among them and taught them all the arts of civilization. (When 
crossing the ice, only about thirty lodges succeeded in getting across, 
and among these were the representatives of all the tribes now in this 
country. At that time the Blackfoot were just one tribe.)  
 When he was through teaching them, he did not die, but went among the 
Sioux, where he remained for a time, but finally disappeared . He took his 
wife with him. He had no children.
