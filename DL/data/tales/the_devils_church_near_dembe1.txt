Many years ago in the woods near Dembe in the vicinity of
Czarnk√≥w there lived a hermit who was in league with the devil and
who also had sold his soul to him.  
 When he realized that he was soon to die, and being afraid of hell, he
summoned the devil and told him that he could have his soul only if he
would fulfill a few wishes. The devil agreed to this, upon which the
hermit asked the devil to fell the oak forest and from the wood to build a
church and a coffin for him. All this was to be completed during the
bewitching hour. He was permitted to have two companions help him with the
work, but no more. The devil agreed to this, and started to work. However,
he did not finish within the prescribed time, for just as he was beginning
to build the tower, the clock struck twelve, and he had to leave.  
  As a consequence of the fear he had suffered, the hermit fell ill, but
he recovered again, and his health improved.  
 In the following week he went to the priest and told him his story. At
first the priest wanted to have the church torn down that had been built
by the devil, but then he decided to complete its construction.  
 From that time on the church was called the devil's church, but it did
not stand long, for that same year it was struck by lightning and burned
completely to the ground.  
 It is said that during the bewitching hour at the place where it stood
the devil can be heard, howling with anger because the hermit's soul
escaped from him. No one dares to settle there for fear that some
misfortune might befall him.
