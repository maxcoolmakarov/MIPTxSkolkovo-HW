The city of Thebes was afflicted with a monster which infested the high-road. It was called the Sphinx. It had the body of a lion, and the upper part of a woman. It lay crouched on the top of a rock, and arrested all travellers who came that way, proposing to them a riddle, with the condition that those who could solve it should pass safe, but those who failed should be killed. Not one had yet succeeded in solving it, and all had been slain.  
Oedipus was not daunted by these alarming accounts, but boldly advanced to the trial.  
The Sphinx asked him, "What animal is that which in the morning goes on four feet, at noon on two, and in the evening upon three?"  
Oedipus replied, "Man, who in childhood creeps on hands and knees, in manhood walks erect, and in old age with the aid of a staff."  
The Sphinx was so mortified at the solving of her riddle that she cast herself down from the rock and perished.
