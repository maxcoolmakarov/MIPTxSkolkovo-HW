A wealthy widow in Karlsruhe had an only daughter whom she loved beyond
measure because she was as beautiful as she was virtuous. At the prime of
her life the girl died, and her mother could not be consoled. She spent
several hours every day in the churchyard crying and mourning at her
child's grave. Early one day as she was again sitting there lamenting, her
daughter's voice called to her from out of the grave, "Mother, please let
me rest!" 
 Shaken, the woman left the cemetery and, to pacify the dead girl,
sought to master her grief.
