There was a shepherd once who went out to the hill to look after his
sheep. It was misty and cold, and he had much trouble to find them. At
last he had them all but one; and after much searching he found that one
too in a peat hag [bog] half drowned. So he took off his plaid, and bent
down and took hold of the sheep's tail, and he pulled! The sheep was heavy
with water, and he could not lift her, so he took off his coat, and he
 pulled!!  But it was too much for him, and he spit on his hands, and
took a good hold of the tail and he PULLED!! And the tail broke! And if it
had not been for that, this tale would have been a great deal longer.
