A fly settled on the head of a bald man and bit him. In his eagerness to 
kill it, he hit himself a smart slap.    
But the fly escaped, and said to him in derision, "You tried to kill me 
for just one little bite; what will you do to yourself now, for the heavy 
smack you have just given yourself?"   
"Oh, for that blow I bear no grudge," he replied, "for I never intended 
myself any harm; but as for you, you contemptible insect, who live by 
sucking human blood, I'd have borne a good deal more than that for the 
satisfaction of dashing the life out of you!"
