on the Gallows 
 
 Now and then there are widows who are not only happy that their
husbands have died, but even those who fail to protect their dead
husbands' bodies beneath the earth in order quickly to gain another
husband. 
 The story is told of a soldier who -- under penalty of death -- had
been ordered to keep watch over the corpse of a distinguished gentleman
who had been hanged. The gallows stood near a graveyard where the body of
a widow's husband lay buried. Following his burial this woman came to the
grave several nights in a row, where she wept and pitifully bemoaned her
husband's death. The soldier heard her cries and came to console her. 
 Upon his return, however, he discovered that the hanged man he was
supposed to be guarding had been stolen. Bad luck! Quickly he ran back and
said, "What can I do, pious woman? While I was consoling you, someone
stole my thief from the gallows, and now I'll be hanged in his place." 
 "Be comforted, soldier! Will you marry me if I can solve your
problem?" 
 "Of course. You have my promise!" 
 "Then hurry and help me. We will dig up my dead husband and hang him on
the gallows in the place of the stolen corpse." 
 With the soldier's help the dead man was dug up, but then the soldier
said, "He doesn't look like the stolen corpse. His teeth are too
long." 
 "We can fix that," said the widow, whereupon she picked up a stone,
knocked out her dead husband's teeth, and then helped hang him up. 
 Afterward she asked the soldier to marry her, as he had promised. 
 "No," said the soldier. "I don't like you, and I won't have you. You
can go to the devil. After the way you treated your dead husband, how
would you treat me, your living husband?"
