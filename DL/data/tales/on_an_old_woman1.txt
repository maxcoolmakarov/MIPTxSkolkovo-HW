A poor traveler who was on his way to study in Paris was asked by an old woman where he was going.  
He answered "To Paris," but she understood "Paradise."  
She then told him about her husband, who had died a few days earlier, and asked the traveler if he would be willing to take some clothes, money, and other things to him.  
The traveler took everything that the old woman gave him and went on his way. Now supplied with many of life's necessities, he became a successful man.
