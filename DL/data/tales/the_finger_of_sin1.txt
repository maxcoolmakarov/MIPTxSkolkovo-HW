A merchant in a town in Hinterpommern had a finger of sin (a finger from an executed person) hidden in the container used to dispense alcohol. Because of this customers streamed to him in great numbers, and his business thrived. While cleaning the cask a servant noticed the chalk-white and bleached-out finger and reported his master to the authorities. The latter was severely punished, and the finger was confiscated from him.   
After having completed his prison sentence the merchant attempted to reestablish his business, but luck was not with him. Customers stayed away, and he had to make his living through begging.
