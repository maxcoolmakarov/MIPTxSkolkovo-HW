There was a king before now, and he married, and he had but one daughter. 
When his wife departed, he would marry none but one whom her clothes would 
fit. His daughter one day tried her mother's dress on, and she came and 
she let her father see how it fitted her. It was fitting her well. When 
her father saw her he would marry no woman but her.   
She went crying where her muime was; and her foster mother said to her, 
"What was the matter with her?"   
She said, "that her father was insisting that he would marry her."   
Her muime told her to say to him, "that she would not marry him till he 
should get her a gown of the swan's down."   
He went, and at the end of a day and a year he came, and the gown with 
him.   
She went again to take the counsel of her muime. "Say to him," said her 
muime, "that thou wilt not marry him till he gets thee a gown of the 
moorland canach."   
She said this to him. He went, and at the end of a day and year he 
returned, and a gown of the moorland canach with him.   
"Say now to him," said her muime, "that thou wilt not marry him till he 
brings thee a gown of silk that will stand on the ground with gold and 
silver."   
At the end of a day and year he returned with the gown.   
"Say to him now," said her muime, "that thou wilt not marry him till he 
brings thee a golden shoe, and a silver shoe."   
He got her a golden shoe and a silver shoe.   
"Say to him now," said her muime, "that thou wilt not marry him unless he 
brings thee a kist that will lock without and within, and for which it is 
all the same to be on sea or on land."   
When she got the kist, she folded the best of her mother's clothes, and of 
her own clothes in it. Then she went herself into the kist, and she asked 
her father to put it out on the sea to try how it would swim. Her father 
put it out; when it was put out, it was going, and going, till it went out 
of sight.   
It went on shore on the other side; and a herd came where it was, 
intending to break it, in hopes that there were findings in the chest.   
When he was going to break it she called out, "Do not so, but say to thy 
father to come here, and he will get that which will better him for life." 
  
His father came, and he took her with him to his own house. It was with a 
king that he was herd, and the king's house was near him.   
"If I could get," said she, "leave to go to service to this great house 
yonder."   
"They want none," said the herd, "unless they want one under the hand of 
the cook."   
The herd went to speak for her, and she went as a servant maid under the 
hand of the cook.   
When the rest were going to the sermon; and when they asked her if she was 
going to it, she said, "that she was not; that she had a little bread to 
bake, and that she could not go to it."   
When they went away, she took herself to the herd's house, and she put on 
a gown of the down of the swan. She went to the sermon, and she sat 
opposite the king's son. The king's son took love for her. She went a 
while before the sermon skailed, she reached the herd's house, she changed 
her clothes, and she was in before them. When the rest came home, it was 
talking about the gentlewoman that was at the sermon they were.   
The next Sunday they said to her, "Was she going to the sermon?" and she 
said, "that she was not, that she had a little bread to bake."   
When they went away, she reached the herd's house, and she put on a gown 
of the moorland canach; and she went to the sermon. The king's son was 
seated where she was the Sunday before, and she sat opposite to him. She 
came out before them, and she changed, and she was at the house before 
them; and when the rest came home, it was talking about the great 
gentlewoman that was at the sermon they were.   
The third Sunday, they said to her, "Was she going to the sermon?" and she 
said, "that she was not, that she had a little bread to bake."   
When they went away, she reached the herd's house. She put on the gown 
that would stand on the ground with gold and silver, and the golden shoe 
and the silver shoe, and she went to the sermon. The king's son was seated 
where she was the Sunday before, and she sat where he was. A watch was set 
on the doors this Sunday. She arose, she saw a cranny, and she jumped out 
at the cranny; but they kept hold of one of the shoes.   
The king's son said, "Whomsoever that shoe would fit, she it was that he 
would marry."   
Many were trying the shoe on, and taking off their toes and heels to try 
if it would fit them; but there were none whom the shoe would fit.   
There was a little bird in the top of a tree, always saying as everyone 
was trying on the shoe, " Beeg beeg ha nan doot a heeg ach don tjay veeg 
a ha fo laiv a hawchkare. " -- Wee wee, it comes not on thee; but on 
the wee one under the hand of the cook.   
When he could get none whom the shoe would fit, the king's son lay down, 
and his mother went to the kitchen to talk over the matter.   
"Won't you let me see the shoe?" said she. "I will not do it any harm at 
all events."   
"Thou! thou ugly dirty thing, that it should fit thee." She went down, and 
she told this to her son.   
"Is it not known," said he, "that it won't fit her at all events? And 
can't you give it her to please her?"   
As soon as the shoe went on the floor, the shoe jumped on her foot.   
"What will you give me," said she, " to let you see the other one?" She 
reached the herd's house, and she put on the shoes, and the dress that 
would stand on the floor with gold and silver. When she returned, there 
was but to send word for a minister, and she herself and the king's son 
married.
