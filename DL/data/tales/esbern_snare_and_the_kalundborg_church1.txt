When Esbern Snare was about building a church in Kalundborg, he saw 
clearly that his means were not fully adequate to the task.  But a troll 
came to him and offered his services; and Esbern Snare made an agreement 
with him on these conditions, that he should be able to tell the troll's 
name when the church was finished; or in case he could not, that he 
should give him his heart and his eyes.
 
The work now went on rapidly, and the troll set the church on stone 
pillars; but when all was nearly done, and there was only half a pillar 
wanting in the church, Esbern began to get frightened, for the name of 
the troll was yet unknown to him.
 
One day he was going about the fields all alone, and in great anxiety on 
account of the perilous state he was in; when, tired, and depressed, by 
reason of his exceeding grief and affliction, he laid him down on 
Ulsh√∏j bank to rest himself a while.  
While he was lying there, he heard a 
troll-woman within the hill saying these words:
 
 
Lie still, baby mine! 
Tomorrow cometh Fin, 
Father thine, 
And giveth thee  
Esbern Snare's 
eyes and heart
 to play with. 
 
 
When Esbern heard this, he recovered his spirits, and went back to the 
church.  The troll was just then coming with the half pillar that was 
wanting from the church; but when Esbern saw him, he hailed him by his 
name, and called him "Fin."  The troll was so enraged at this, that he 
went off with the half pillar through the air, and this is the reason 
that the church has but three pillars and a half.
