There are no longer any underground people; the wild huntsman would not 
leave them in peace. Finally they engaged a ferryman in LÃ¼bek to take 
them across the great water (the Baltic). One of them made the 
arrangements, and before the ferryman knew what was happening his entire 
ship was overloaded with underground people, for all of them wanted to go. 
They paid very well, and the man's family still has wealth from that time. 
  
When they were still active here at a certain house in Stocksee no one 
could raise calves to maturity. They always died in their first days. Then 
once, after they had lost another one, a tiny little woman appeared to 
them and said, "People, you cannot raise calves here, because my bed is 
directly beneath their stall. Whenever its manure drips down, the calf has 
to die."   
Then the people moved the stall and the misfortune ceased.
