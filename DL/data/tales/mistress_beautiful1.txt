city there was a wonderfully beautiful but poor girl. A merchant fell in
love with her and asked her to marry him. However, because merchants
expect a rich dowry, before the wedding she gave herself over to the
devil. Thus the devil brought her great wealth under the condition that
she would have to discover his name within one year, otherwise the devil
would take her.  
 
The year's end was approaching, and she still did not
know the devil's name.   
One night a shepherd was lying in his hut just
outside the city when he saw a fire not far away. Walking toward the fire,
he came to a hill. There he saw various beings dancing around. One of them
was particularly cheerful as he jumped around the fire, singing: 
 It is good; it is good,  That Mistress Beautiful does not
know,  That my name is Hipche, Hipche.   
The next day the
shepherd want to the merchant's wife and told her what he had seen and
heard. She took note of the name, and when the year had come to an end,
the devil appeared before her, and she stated the name:  Hipche.   
Thus
the devil was defeated, and Mistress Beautiful lived happily and
prosperously with her merchant. With the money that she had received from
the devil, their trade expanded across the land and over the sea.
