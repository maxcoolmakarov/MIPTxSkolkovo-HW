There was once a great city that depended for its water supply upon a
fountain without the walls. A great dragon, possessed and moved by Satan
himself, took possession of the fountain and refused to allow water to be
taken unless, whenever people came to the spring, a youth or maiden was
given to him to devour. The people tried again and again to destroy the
monster; but though the flower of the city cheerfully went forth against
it, its breath was so pestilential that they used to drop down dead before
they came within bow-shot. 
 The terrorized inhabitants were thus obliged to sacrifice their
offspring, or die of thirst; till at last all the youth of the place had
perished except the king's daughter. So great was the distress of their
subjects for want of water that her heart-broken parents could no longer
withhold her, and amid the tears of the populace she went out towards the
spring, where the dragon lay awaiting her. But just as the noisome monster
was going to leap on her, Mar Jiryis appeared, in golden panoply, upon a
fine white steed, and spear in hand. Riding full tilt at the dragon, he
struck it fair between the eyes and laid it dead. The king, out of
gratitude for this unlooked-for succor, gave Mar Jiryis his daughter and
half of his kingdom.
