Two women in Jetzschko were baking a pancake, and when it was almost 
done they began to quarrel, because each one wanted the whole thing. 
 The one woman said, "I get the pancake!" 
 The other one replied, "No, I want all of it!" 
 Before they knew what was happening, the pancake suddenly grew feet, 
jumped out of the pan, and ran away. 
 He came to a fox, who said to him, "Pancake, pancake, where are you 
going?" 
 The pancake answered, "I ran away from two old women, and I shall run 
away from you as well!" 
 Then he met a hare. It too shouted, "Pancake, pancake, where are you 
going?" 
 The pancake answered, "I ran away from two old women, Reynard the Fox, 
and I shall run away from you as well. 
 The pancake ran on until he came to some water. A ship full of people 
was floating on the water. They too cried out to him, "Pancake, pancake, 
where are you going?" 
 Again he said, "I ran away from two old women, Reynard the Fox, Speedy 
the Hare, and I shall run away from you as well." 
 Then he came to a large pig. It too shouted to him, "Pancake, pancake, 
where are you going?" 
 "Oh," he said, "I ran away from two old women, Reynard the Fox, Speedy 
the Hare, a ship full of people, and I shall run away from you as 
well." 
 The pig said, "Pancake, I am hard of hearing. You'll have to say it 
into my ear!" 
 So the pancake went up close, and bam! bam! the pig snatched him and 
ate him up, and with that the story is ended.
