Many years ago there lived on the then barren plain of Suruga a woodsman 
by the name of Visu.  He was a giant in stature, and lived in a hut with 
his wife and children. 
One day Visu received a visit from an old priest, who said to him: 
"Honorable woodsman, I am afraid you never pray." 
Visu replied: "If you had a wife and a large family to keep, you would 
never have time to pray." 
This remark made the priest angry, and the old man gave the woodcutter a 
vivid description of the horror of being reborn as a toad, or a mouse, or 
an insect for millions of years.  Such lurid details were not to Visu's 
liking, and he accordingly promised the priest that in future he would 
pray. 
"Work and pray," said the priest as he took his departure. 
Unfortunately Visu did nothing but pray.  He prayed all day long and 
refused to do any work, so that his rice crops withered and his wife and 
family starved.  Visu's wife, who had hitherto never said a harsh or 
bitter word to her husband, now became extremely angry, and, pointing to 
the poor thin bodies of her children, she exclaimed: "Rise, Visu, take up 
your ax and do something more helpful to us all than the mere mumbling of 
prayers!" 
Visu was so utterly amazed at what his wife had said that it was some 
time before he could think of a fitting reply.  When he did so his words 
came hot and strong to the ears of his poor, much-wronged wife. 
"Woman," said he, "the Gods come first.  You are an impertinent creature 
to speak to me so, and I will have nothing more to do with you!"  Visu 
snatched up his ax and, without looking round to say farewell, he left 
the hut, strode out of the wood, and climbed up Fujiyama, where a mist 
hid him from sight. 
When Visu had seated himself upon the mountain he heard a soft rustling 
sound, and immediately afterward saw a fox dart into a thicket.  Now Visu 
deemed it extremely lucky to see a fox, and, forgetting his prayers, he 
sprang up, and ran hither and thither in the hope of again finding this 
sharp-nosed little creature. 
He was about to give up the chase when, coming to an open space in a 
wood, he saw two ladies sitting down by a brook playing go.  The woodsman 
was so completely fascinated that he could do nothing but sit down and 
watch them.  There was no sound except the soft click of pieces on the 
board and the song of the running brook.  The ladies took no notice of 
Visu, for they seemed to be playing a strange game that had no end, a 
game that entirely absorbed their attention.  Visu could not keep his 
eyes off these fair women.  He watched their long black hair and the 
little quick hands that shot out now and again from their big silk 
sleeves in order to move the pieces. 
After he had been sitting there for three hundred years, though to him it 
was but a summer's afternoon, he saw that one of the players had made a 
false move.  "Wrong, most lovely lady!" he exclaimed excitedly.  In a 
moment these women turned into foxes and ran away. 
When Visu attempted to pursue them he found to his horror that his limbs 
were terribly stiff, that his hair was very long, and that his beard 
touched the ground.  He discovered, moreover, that the handle of his ax, 
though made of the hardest wood, had crumbled away into a little heap of 
dust. 
After many painful efforts Visu was able to stand on his feet and proceed 
very slowly toward his little home.  When he reached the spot he was 
surprised to see no hut, and, perceiving a very old woman, he said: "Good 
lady, I am amazed to find that my little home has disappeared.  I went 
away this afternoon, and now in the evening it has vanished!" 
The old woman, who believed that a madman was addressing her, inquired 
his name.  When she was told, she exclaimed: "Bah!  You must indeed be 
mad!  Visu lived three hundred years ago!  He went away one day, and he 
never came back again." 
"Three hundred years!" murmured Visu.  "It cannot be possible.  Where are 
my dear wife and children?" 
"Buried!" hissed the old woman, "and, if what you say is true, you 
children's children too.  The Gods have prolonged your miserable life in 
punishment for having neglected your wife and little children." 
Big tears ran down Visu's withered cheeks as he said in a husky voice: "I 
have lost my manhood.  I have prayed when my dear ones starved and needed 
the labor of my once strong hands.  Old woman, remember my last words: 
"If you pray, work too!" 
We do not know how long the poor but repentant Visu lived after he 
returned from his strange adventures.  His white spirit is still said to 
haunt Fujiyama when the moon shines brightly.
