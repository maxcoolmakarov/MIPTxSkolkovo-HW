A pastor at Krailsheim had old large books secured with chains to the 
walls and ceilings of a vaulted room. One time a servant girl was alone 
in this room, and out of curiosity she opened one of the books and read 
aloud a passage from it. Suddenly the entire room was crawling with mice, 
causing the servant girl to cry for help.   
At her cry the pastor the pastor came to her, and she hurriedly told him 
what had happened. He then read the passage from end to beginning, upon 
which the mice all disappeared.
