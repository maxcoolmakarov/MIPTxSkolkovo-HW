Nasreddin was strolling through the marketplace when a shopkeeper 
accosted him, berating the Hodja loudly for his failure to pay a debt. 
 
 "My dear friend," answered the Hodja, "just how much do I owe you?" 
 
 "Seventy-five piasters," shouted the angry shopkeeper.  
 "Now, now," replied the Hodja. "You must know that I intend to pay you 
thirty-five piasters tomorrow, and next month another thirty-five. That 
means that I owe you only five piasters. Are you not ashamed of yourself 
for accosting me so loudly in public for a debt of only five piasters?"
