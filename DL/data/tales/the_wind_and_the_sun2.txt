Once the Wind and the Sun disputed as to which was the more powerful.
And while they were quarreling, a man came by wrapped in a shawl and
wearing a big  pagri  [head cloth or turban]. And they said, "It is
no good quarreling. Let us put our power to the test and see who can
deprive this man of the shawl he has wrapped round him." 
 Then the Wind asked to be allowed to try first and said, "You will see
that I will blow away the blanket in no time," and the Sun said, "All
right, you go first." 
 So the Wind began to blow hard, but the man only wrapped his shawl more
tightly round him to prevent its being blown away and fastened it round
himself with his  pagri ; and though the Wind blew fit to blow the
man away, it could not snatch the shawl from him. So it gave up, and the
Sun had a try. He rose in the sky and blazed with full force, and soon the
man began to drip with sweat, and he took off his shawl and hung it on the
stick he carried over his shoulder, and the Wind had to admit defeat.
