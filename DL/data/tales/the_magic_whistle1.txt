Sæmund the Wise owned a whistle that would sommon one or more imps, 
and they would have to serve the person who had blown the whistle.  One 
day a servant girl discovered the whistle, which Sæmund had hidden 
in his bed. Her curiousity led her to pick it up and blow it. Immediately 
an imp appeared and demanded a task from her.   
Now ten of Sæmund's sheep had been slaughtered that day, and their 
fleeces were lying outside. The girl told the imp to count the hairs on 
all the fleeces, and that if he could do so before she finished making the 
bed, she would belong to him.  
The imp hurried away and began his task, but the girl was even faster. He 
still had one fleece left to count when she had finished making the bed, 
so he lost the bargain.   
Later Sæmund asked the girl if she had found anything in the bed. 
She told him everything, and he was pleased with her presence of mind.
