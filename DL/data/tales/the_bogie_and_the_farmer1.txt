The following legend, very commonly narrated in Northamptonshire, places 
this [the Bogies lack of cunning] in a strong light:  
One of these spirits [a Bogie] once asserted a claim to a field hitherto 
possessed by a farmer, and, after much disputing, they came to an 
arrangement by agreeing to divide its produce between them. At seed-time 
the farmer asks the Bogie what part of the crop he will have, "tops or 
bottoms."  
"Bottoms," said the spirit. Upon hearing which his crafty antagonist sows 
the field with wheat, so that when harvest arrived the corn [grain] falls 
to his share, while the poor Bogie is obliged to content himself with the 
stubble.  
Next year the Bogie, finding he had made such an unfortunate selection in 
the bottoms, chose the "tops," whereupon the crafty farmer sets the field 
with turnips -- thus, again, outwitting the simple claimant.  
Tired of this unprofitable farming, the Bogie agrees to hazard his claims 
on a mowing match, the land in question to be the stake for which they 
played. Before the day of meeting the canny earth-tiller procures a number 
of iron bars, which he strews among the grass to be mown by his opponent; 
and when the trial commences, the unsuspecting goblin finds his progress 
retarded by his scythe continually coming into contact with these 
obstacles, which he takes to be some hard species of dock.  
"Mortal hard docks these!" said he. "Nation hard docks!"  
His blunted blade soon brings him to a standstill; and as, in such cases, 
it is not allowable for one to sharpen without the other, he turns to his 
antagonist, now far ahead, and in a tone of despair inquires, "When dye 
wiffle waffle (whet), mate?"  
"Waffle!" said the farmer, with a well-feigned stare of amazement, "oh, 
about noon, mebby."  
"Then," said the despairing Bogie, "I've lost my land!"  
So saying, he disappeared, and the farmer reaped the reward of his 
artifice by ever afterwards continuing the undisputed possessor of the 
soil.
