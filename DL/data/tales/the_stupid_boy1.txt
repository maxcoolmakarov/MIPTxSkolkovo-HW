In a certain city there are a Gamarala, a Gama-gaeni (his wife), and a son 
of theirs. The Gamarala went to the Chena. The Gama-gaeni lay down and 
told the Gama-puta (the son) to examine her head (for insects). While he 
was looking through the hair she fell asleep, and a fly settled on her 
head. "Ade! Fly, do not bite our mother's head," he said. "Mother will 
scold me."   
The fly having gone flying away, settled again on her head. Saying ,"Now 
then, this fly is biting mother's head again," he placed his mother's head 
gently on the ground. Then having gone and taken a rice pestle, and come 
back with it, he said, "Is the fly still biting the head?" and struck at 
the fly with the rice pestle, killing his mother with the blow.   
The boy's father having come, tried to arouse her. "How is it that mother 
is dead?" he asked.   
The boy said, "A fly was biting our mother's head. I struck it with the 
rice pestle. Because of it she died."   
So the Gamarala took the woman away and buried her.
