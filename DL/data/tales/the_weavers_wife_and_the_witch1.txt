Once upon a time a weaver and his wife lived at lived at Sutton-on-Trent 
in Nottinghamshire. One day the weaver went to Neward to sell his linen, 
leaving his children in the house, and his wife, who lay ill in bed. Now 
at that time there lived at Sutton a witch who had some spite against the 
weaver's wife. A short time after the weaver had gone one of the children 
heard a noise as of something pattering up and down stairs. The child 
opened the door of the bottom stairs, and there she saw a great ugly cat, 
which she could not catch, try as she would. As she was trying to catch it 
the cat ran upstairs, sprang upon the bed where the poor woman lay, and 
clawed her. But the woman roused herself and knocked the cat down.  
Now when the weaver came back from Newark the children told him about the 
cat. So he watched all night in an old lumber-room, for the cat came in 
and went out through a broken pane in the window.  
One night the cat came in as the weaver was sitting by the fire, so he 
picked up a fork and struck her on the cheek. He then threw her out of 
doors, believing that she was dead. But in the morning, when he went to 
look for the cat's body, he could not find it. But ever after that the 
witch had her face tied up, and she had no more power to do harm to the 
weaver or to his family.
