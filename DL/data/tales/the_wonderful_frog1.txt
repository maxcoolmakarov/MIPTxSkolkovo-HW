There was once, I don't know where, a man who had three daughters. One day 
the father thus spoke to the eldest girl, "Go, my daughter, and fetch me, 
some fresh water from the well."   
The girl went, but when she came to the well a huge frog called out to her 
from the bottom, that he would not allow her to draw water in her jug 
until she threw him down the gold ring on her finger.   
"Nothing else? Is that all you want?" replied the girl. "I won't give away 
my rings to such an ugly creature as you." And she returned as she came 
with the empty pitchers.   
So the father sent the second girl, and she fared as the first; the frog 
would not let her have any water, as she refused to throw down her gold 
ring. Her father gave his two elder daughters a good scolding, and then 
thus addressed the youngest, "You go, Betsie, my dear, you have always 
been a clever girl. I'm sure you will be able to get some water, and will 
not allow your father to suffer thirst. So, shame your sisters!"   
Betsie picked up the pitchers and went, but the frog again refused the 
water unless she threw her ring down; but she, as she was very fond of her 
father, threw the ring in as demanded, and returned home with full 
pitchers to her father's great delight.   
In the evening, as soon as darkness set in, the frog crawled out of the 
well, and thus commenced to shout in front of Betsie's father's door, 
"Father-in-law! Father-in-law! I should like something to eat."   
The man got angry, and called out to his daughters; "Give something in a 
broken plate to that ugly frog to gnaw."   
"Father-in-law! Father-in-law! This won't do for me; I want some roast 
meat on a tin plate," retorted the frog.   
"Give him something on a tin plate then, or else he will cast a spell on 
us," said the father.   
The frog began to eat heartily, and, having had enough, again commenced to 
croak: "Father-in-law! Father- in-law! I want something to drink."   
"Give him some slops in a broken pot," said the father.   
"Father-in-law! Father-in-law! I won't have this; I want some wine in a 
nice tumbler."   
"Give him some wine then," angrily called out the father.   
He guzzled up his wine and began again, "Father-in-law! Father-in-law! I 
would like to go to sleep."   
"Throw him some rags in a corner," was the reply.   
"Father-in-law! Father-in-law! I won't have that; I want a silk bed," 
croaked the frog. This was also given to him; but no sooner has he gone to 
bed than again he began to croak, "Father-in-law! Father-in-law! I want a 
girl, indeed."   
"Go, my daughter, and lie by the side of him," said the father to the 
eldest.   
"Father-in-law! Father-in law! I don't want that, I want another."   
The father sent the second girl, but the frog again croaked: 
"Father-in-law! Father-in-law! I don't want that, Betsie is the girl I 
want."   
"Go, my Betsie," said the father, quite disheartened, "else this 
confounded monster will cast a spell on us."   
So Betsie went to bed with the frog, but her father thoughtfully left a 
lamp burning on the top of the oven; noticing which, the frog crawled out 
of bed and blew the lamp out. The father lighted it again, but the frog 
put it out as before, and so it happened a third time. The father saw that 
the frog would not yield, and was therefore obliged to leave his dear 
little Betsie in the dark by the side of the ugly frog, and felt great 
anxiety about her.   
In the morning, when the father and the two elder girls got up, they 
opened their eyes and mouths wide in astonishment, because the frog had 
disappeared, and by the side of Betsie they found a handsome Magyar lad, 
with auburn locks, in a beautiful costume, with gold braid and buttons and 
gold spurs on his boots. The handsome lad asked for Betsie's hand, and, 
having received the father's consent, they hastened to celebrate the 
wedding, so that christening might not follow the wedding too soon.   
The two elder sisters looked with invidious eyes on Betsie, as they also 
were very much smitten with the handsome lad. Betsie was very happy after, 
so happy that if anyone doubt it he can satisfy himself with his own eyes. 
If she is still alive, let him go and look for her, and try to find her in 
this big world.
