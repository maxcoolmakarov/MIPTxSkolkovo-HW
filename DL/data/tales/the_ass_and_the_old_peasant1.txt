An old peasant was sitting in a meadow watching his ass, which was grazing 
close by, when all of a sudden he caught 

sight of armed men stealthily approaching. He jumped up in a moment, and 
begged the ass to fly with him as fast as he 

could, "Or else," said he, "we shall both be captured by the enemy." But 
the ass just looked round lazily and said, 

"And if so, do you think they'll make me carry heavier loads than I have 
to now?" "No," said his master. "Oh, well, 

then," said the ass, "I don't mind if they do take me, for I shan't be any 
worse off."
