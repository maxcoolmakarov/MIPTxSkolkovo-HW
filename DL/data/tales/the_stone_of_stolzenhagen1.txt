Stolzenhagen Field is under the jurisdiction of MÃ¼llenbeck in
Mittelmark and is not far at all from Lake Wandelitz.  In this field there is an enormous stone which extends several feet beneath the earth and which has the imprint on its top of a very large and powerful man's hand.  The five fingers can still be recognized clearly and distinctly. 
The people of Wandelitz relate that in ancient times this stone lay on the
other side of Lake Wandelitz.  An enormous giant lived there, and in order to
prove his strength he picked up the stone, pressed his five fingers into it --
leaving their imprint -- and then threw it across the lake.
