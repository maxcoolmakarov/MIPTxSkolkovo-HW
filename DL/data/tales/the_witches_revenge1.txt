Many years ago a night watchman in Schwerte was courting two sisters at
the same time, but without being serious about marriage.  Each of them
asked him about this several times, but to no avail.  Therefore at last
they got together and swore revenge against him.  Now both of these
sisters were witches. One night when the night watchman was lying in bed
there came a knock at his window. When he opened it, the two of them took
hold of him, picked him up, and carried him high into the air.  At first
they wanted to throw him into the Ruhr River, but they reconsidered and
set him, entirely naked, at the top of a tall tree where he was found half
dead the next day.
