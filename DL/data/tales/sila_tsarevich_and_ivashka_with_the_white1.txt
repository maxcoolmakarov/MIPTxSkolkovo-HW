There was once a tsar, named Chotei, who had three sons -- the first, 
Aspar Tsarevich; the second, Adam 

Tsarevich; and the third and youngest son, Sila Tsarevich. The two eldest 
brothers entreated their father's 

permission to travel in foreign countries and see the world. Then the 
youngest brother, Sila Tsarevich, also begged 

the tsar's permission to travel with his brothers.   
But Chotei said, "My dear son, you are still young, and not used to the 
difficulties of traveling; remain at home, 

and think no more of this fancy you have taken."   
But Sila Tsarevich had a great longing to see foreign lands, and entreated 
his father so much that at length the tsar 

consented, and gave him a ship likewise. As soon as the three brothers 
embarked, each on board his ship, they all 

gave orders to set sail. And when they were out on the open sea, the 
eldest brother's ship sailed first, the second 

brother's next, and Sila Tsarevich sailed last.   
On the third day of the voyage they saw a coffin with iron bands floating 
on the waves. The two eldest brothers 

sailed past without heeding it, but as soon as Sila Tsarevich saw the 
coffin, he ordered the sailors to pick it up, lay 

it on board his ship, and carry it to land.   
The next day a violent storm arose, by which Sila's ship was driven out of 
its course, and cast upon a steep shore in 

an unknown country. Then Sila ordered his sailors to take the coffin and 
to carry it on shore, whither he himself 

followed, and buried it in the earth.    
Thereupon Sila Tsarevich ordered the captain to remain upon the spot where 
the ship was stranded, and await his 

return for three years; but adding that, should he not come back in that 
time, he should be free to set sail and 

return home. So saying, Sila took leave of his captain and his crew, and 
went forthwith, journeying on and on.   
He wandered about for a long while, without seeing anyone; at length he 
heard a man running after him, dressed 

all in white. Then Sila Tsarevich turned round and saw the man following 
him; whereupon he instantly drew his 

sword to be upon his guard. But no sooner did the man come up to him than 
he fell on his knees and thanked Sila 

for having saved him. And Sila asked the man what he had done to deserve 
his thanks.   
Then the stranger stood up and answered, "Ah, Sila Tsarevich, how can I 
thank you enough? There I lay in the 

coffin, which you picked up at sea and buried; and had it not been for you 
I might have remained floating about 

for a hundred years."   
"But how did you get into the coffin?" asked Sila.   
"Listen, and I will tell you the whole story," replied Ivashka. "I was a 
great magician; my mother was told that I did 

great mischief to mankind by my arts, and therefore ordered me to be put 
into the coffin and set adrift on the 

open sea. For more than a hundred years I have been floating about, and no 
one has ever picked me up; but to you 

I owe my rescue, and I will therefore serve you, and render you all the 
help in my power. Let me ask you whether 

you have not a wish to marry. I know the beautiful Queen Truda, who is 
worthy of being your wife."    
Sila replied that if this queen were indeed beautiful, he was willing to 
marry her; and Ivashka told him she was 

the most beautiful woman in the world. When Sila heard this, he begged 
Ivashka to accompany him to her 

kingdom. So they set out and traveled on and on till they reached that 
country.   
Now, Queen Truda's kingdom was surrounded by a palisade; and upon every 
stake was stuck a man's head, except 

one, which had no head. When Sila saw this, he was terrified, and asked 
Ivashka what it meant; and Ivashka told 

him that these were the heads of heroes who had been suitors to Queen 
Truda. Sila shuddered on hearing this, 

and wished to return home without showing himself to the father of Truda. 
But Ivashka told him to fear nothing 

and go with him boldly, so Sila went on.   
When they entered the kingdom, Ivashka said, "Hearken Sila Tsarevich, I 
will be your servant, and when you enter 

the royal halls, salute King Salom humbly. Then he will ask you whence you 
came, and whose son you are, what is 

your name and business. Tell him everything and conceal nothing; but say 
that you are come to sue for his 

daughter's hand. He will give her to you with great joy."   
So Sila Tsarevich went into the palace, and, as soon as Prince Salom saw 
him, he went himself to meet him, took 

him by his white hands, led him into the marble halls, and asked him, 
"Fair youth, from what country do you 

come, whose son are you, what is your name, and what is your business?" 
  
"I am from the kingdom of my father the Tsar Chotei," replied Sila. "My 
name is Sila Tsarevich, and I am come to 

sue for your daughter, the beautiful Queen Truda."   
King Salom was overjoyed that the son of such a renowned tsar should be 
his son-in-law, and immediately 

ordered his daughter to prepare for the wedding. And when the day for the 
marriage came, the king commanded 

all his princes and boyars to assemble in the palace; and they all went in 
procession to the church, and Sila 

Tsarevich was married to the fair Queen Truda. Then they returned to the 
palace, seated themselves at table, and 

feasted and made merry.   
When the time came to retire to rest, Ivashka took Sila aside and 
whispered to him, "Hark, ye, Sila Tsarevich, 

when you go to rest, beware lest you speak a word to your bride or you 
will not remain alive, and your head will be 

stuck on the last stake. She will in every way try to make you embrace 
her, but attend to what I say."   
Then Sila Tsarevich enquired why he warned him thus, and Ivashka replied, 
"She is in league with an evil spirit, 

who comes to her every night in the shape of a man, but flies through the 
air in the shape of a six-headed dragon. 

Now, if she lays her hand upon your breast and presses it, jump up and 
beat her with a stick until all her strength 

is gone. I will meanwhile remain on watch at the door of your apartment." 
  
When Sila Tsarevich heard this, he went with his wife to rest, and Queen 
Truda tried in every way to get him to 

kiss her, but Sila lay quite still and spoke not a word. Then Truda laid 
her hand upon his breast and pressed him so 

hard that he could scarcely breathe. But up jumped Sila Tsarevich and 
seized the stick which Ivashka had laid 

there ready for him, and fell to beating her as hard as he could.   
On a sudden there arose a storm, and a six-headed dragon came flying into 
the room and was going to devour Sila 

Tsarevich, but Ivashka seized a sharp sword and attacked the dragon, and 
they fought three hours, and Ivashka 

struck off two of the dragon's heads, whereupon the monster flew away. 
Then Ivashka desired Sila Tsarevich to go 

to sleep and fear nothing. Sila obeyed him, laid himself down, and fell 
asleep.   
Early in the morning King Salom went to be informed whether his dear son 
still lived, and when he heard that Sila 

was alive and well, the king rejoiced, since he was the first who had been 
saved from his daughter; and he instantly 

ordered Sila to be called, and the whole day was spent in merrymaking.   
The following night Ivashka gave Sila Tsarevich the same caution as 
before, not to speak a word to his wife, and he 

placed himself on watch at the door. Then it fell out as before, and when 
Sila Tsarevich began to beat the queen, 

on a sudden the dragon came flying in, and was going to devour Sila 
Tsarevich. But Ivashka rushed from behind 

the door, sword in hand, and fought with the dragon and struck off two 
more of his heads. Then the dragon flew 

away, and Sila Tsarevich lay down to sleep. Early in the morning the king 
commanded Sila to be invited, and they 

spent this day in the same pleasures as before.    
The third night the same happened again, and Ivashka cut off the last two 
heads of the dragon, and he burnt all 

the heads and strewed the ashes in the fields.   
Thus time passed on, and Sila Tsarevich lived with his father-in-law a 
whole year, without speaking to his wife or 

gaining her love. Then Ivashka told him one day to go to King Salom and 
ask permission to return to his native 

country. So Sila went to the king, who dismissed him, and gave him two 
squadrons of his army to accompany him 

as an escort. Then Sila took leave of his father-in-law, and set out with 
his wife on their journey to his own country. 

  
When they had gone half way, Ivashka told Sila Tsarevich to halt and pitch 
his tent. So Sila obeyed and ordered 

the tent to be put up. The next day Ivashka laid pieces of wood in front 
of Sila's tent and set fire to them. Then he 

led Queen Truda out of the tent, unsheathed his sword, and cut her in 
twain.   
Sila Tsarevich shuddered with terror and began to weep; but Ivashka said, 
"Weep not, she will come to life again." 

  
And presently all sorts of evil things came forth from the body, and 
Ivashka threw them all into the fire. Then he 

said to Sila Tsarevich, "See you not the evil spirits which troubled your 
wife? She is now relieved from them."   
And, so saying, he laid the parts of Truda's body together, sprinkled them 
with the water of life, and the queen 

was instantly sound and whole as before.   
Then said Ivashka, "Now, farewell, Sila Tsarevich, you will find that your 
wife loves you truly, but you will never see 

me more." And so saying he vanished.   
Sila Tsarevich ordered the tent to be struck, and journeyed on to his 
native country. And when he came to the 

place where his ship was waiting for him, he went onboard with the fair 
Queen Truda, dismissed the escort which 

accompanied him, and set sail. And on arriving at his own kingdom, he was 
welcomed with salvos of cannon, and 

Tsar Chotei came out of his palace and took him and the beautiful Queen 
Truda by their lily-white hands, led 

them into the marble halls, placed them at table, and they feasted and 
made merry.  
Sila Tsarevich lived with his father two years. Then he returned to the 
kingdom of King Salom, received from him 

the crown, and ruled over the country with his Queen Truda in great love 
and happiness.
