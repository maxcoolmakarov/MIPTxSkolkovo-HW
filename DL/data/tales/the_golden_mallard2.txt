Once upon a time when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the 
Bodhisatta was born a Brahmin, and growing up was married to a bride of 
his own rank, who bore him three daughters named Nanda, Nanda-vati, and 
Sundari-nanda. The Bodhisatta dying, they were taken in by neighbors and 
friends, whilst he was born again into the world as a golden mallard 
endowed with consciousness of its former existences. 
 Growing up, the bird viewed its own magnificent size and golden 
plumage, and remembered that previously it had been a human being. 
Discovering that his wife and daughters were living on the charity of 
others, the mallard bethought him of his plumage like hammered and beaten 
gold and how by giving them a golden feather at a time he could enable his 
wife and daughters to live in comfort. So away he flew to where they dwelt 
and alighted on the top of the central beam of the roof. Seeing the 
Bodhisatta, the wife and girls asked where he had come from; and he told 
them that he was their father who had died and been born a golden mallard, 
and that he had come to visit them and put an end to their miserable 
necessity of working for hire. 
 "You shall have my feathers," said he, "one by one, and they will sell 
for enough to keep you all in ease and comfort." 
 So saying, he gave them one of his feathers and departed. And from time 
to time he returned to give them another feather, and with the proceeds of 
their sale these Brahmin women grew prosperous and quite well to do. 
 But one day the mother said to her daughters, "There's no trusting 
animals, my children. Who's to say your father might not go away one of 
these days and never come back again? Let us use our time and pluck him 
clean next time he comes, so as to make sure of all his feathers." 
 Thinking this would pain him, the daughters refused. 
 The mother in her greed called the golden mallard to her one day when 
he came, and then took him with both hands and plucked him. 
 Now the Bodhisatta's feathers had this property that if they were 
plucked out against his wish, they ceased to be golden and became like a 
crane's feathers. And now the poor bird, though he stretched his wings, 
could not fly, and the woman flung him into a barrel and gave him food 
there. As time went on his feathers grew again (though they were plain 
white ones now), and he flew away to his own abode and never came back 
again.
