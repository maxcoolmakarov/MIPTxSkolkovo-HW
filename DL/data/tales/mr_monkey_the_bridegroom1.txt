There was a monkey which fell in love with a beautiful young girl. He
dressed as a man and went to call on her. He was so well received that one
day he took his best friend with him to see his lady-love. The young
girl's father asked Mr. Monkey's friend some questions about his
daughter's lover.
 The friend said that Mr. Monkey was good and rich, but there was a
secret about him.
 The father wanted to know the secret, but the friend said he would tell
him another day.
 Mr. Monkey was finally engaged to the young lady, and the night of the
wedding he invited his friend to the supper. The latter was jealous of Mr.
Monkey, and at the end of the supper he began to sing. This was a song
that made all monkeys dance, whether they wished to or not, so Mr. Monkey
looked at his friend and beckoned him to stop singing.
 He continued, however, to sing, and all at once Mr. Monkey got up and
began to dance. He jumped about so wildly that his tail came out of his
clothes, and everyone saw that he was a monkey.
 The father understood the secret, and beat him dreadfully.
 His friend, however, ran off, dancing and singing.
