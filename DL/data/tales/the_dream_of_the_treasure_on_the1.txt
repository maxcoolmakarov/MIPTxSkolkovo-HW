Bridge 
 
 Some time ago a man dreamed that he should go to the bridge at
Regensburg where he would become rich. He went there, and after spending
some fourteen days there a wealthy merchant, who wondered why was spending
so much time on the bridge, approached him and asked him what he was doing
there. 
 The latter answered, "I dreamed that I was to go to the bridge at
Regensburg, where I would become rich." 
 "What?" said the merchant, "You came here because of a dream? Dreams
are fantasies and lies. Why I myself dreamed that there is a large pot of
gold buried beneath that large tree over there." And he pointed to the
tree. "But I paid no attention, for dreams are fantasies." 
 Then the visitor went and dug beneath the tree, where he found a great
treasure that made him rich, and thus his dream was confirmed. 
Agricola adds: "I have often heard this from my dear father."  
This legend is also told about other cities, for example about Lübeck (or Kempen), where a baker's servant dreams that he will find a treasure on the bridge. Upon going there and walking back and forth, a beggar speaks to him, telling how he has dreamed that a treasure lies beneath a linden tree in the churchyard at Möln (or at Dordrecht beneath a bush) but that he is not about to go there.  
The baker's servant answers, "Yes, dreams are often nothing but foolishness. I will give my bridge-treasure to you."  
With that he departed and dug up the treasure from beneath the linden tree.
