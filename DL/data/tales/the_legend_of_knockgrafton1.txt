There was once a poor man who lived in the fertile glen of Aherlow, at the
foot
of the gloomy Galtee mountains, and he had a great hump on his back: he
looked
just as if his body had been rolled up and placed upon his shoulders; and
his
head was pressed down with the weight so much that his chin, when he was
sitting, used to rest upon his knees for support. 
The country people were rather shy of meeting him in any lonesome place,
for
though, poor creature, he was as harmless and as inoffensive as a new-born
infant, yet his deformity was so great that he scarcely appeared to be a
human
creature, and some ill-minded persons had set strange stories about him
afloat. 
He was said to have a great knowledge of herbs and charms; but certain it
was
that he had a mighty skillful hand in plaiting straw and rushes into hats
and
baskets, which was the way he made his livelihood. 
Lusmore, for that was the nickname put upon him by reason of his always
wearing
a sprig of the fairy cap, or lusmore (the foxglove), in his little straw
hat,
would ever get a higher penny for his plaited work than any one else, and
perhaps that was the reason why some one, out of envy, had circulated the
strange stories about him.  Be that as it may, it happened that he was
returning
one evening from the pretty town of Cahir towards Cappagh, and as little
Lusmore
walked very slowly, on account of the great hump upon his back, it was
quite
dark when he came to the old moat of Knockgrafton, which stood on the
right-hand
side of his road.  Tired and weary was he, and noways comfortable in his
own
mind at thinking how much farther he had to travel, and that he should be
walking all the night; so he sat down under the moat to rest himself, and
began
looking mournfully enough upon the moon. 
Presently there rose a wild strain of unearthly melody upon the ear of
little
Lusmore; he listened, and he thought that he had never heard such
ravishing
music before.  It was like the sound of many voices, each mingling and
blending
with the other so strangely that they seemed to be one, though all singing
different strains, and the words of the song were these:  "Da Luan, Da
Mort, Da
Luan, Da Mort, Da Luan, Da Mort"; when there would be a moment's pause,
and then
the round of melody went on again. 
Lusmore listened attentively, scarcely drawing his breath lest he might
lose the
slightest note.  He now plainly perceived that the singing was within the
moat;
and though at first it had charmed him so much, he began to get tired of
hearing
the same round sung over and over so often without any change; so availing
himself of the pause when the "Da Luan, Da Mort" had been sung three
times, he
took up the tune, and raised it with the words "augus Da Cadine," and then
went
on singing with the voices inside of the moat, "Da Luan, Da Mort,"
finishing the
melody, when the pause again came, with "augus Da Cadine." 
The fairies within Knockgrafton, for the song was a fairy melody, when
they
heard this addition to the tune, were so much delighted that, with instant
resolve, it was determined to bring the mortal among them, whose musical
skill
so far exceeded theirs, and little Lusmore was conveyed into their company
with
the eddying speed of a whirlwind. 
Glorious to behold was the sight that burst upon him as he came down
through the
moat, twirling round and round, with the lightness of a straw, to the
sweetest
music that kept time to his motion.  The greatest honor was then paid him,
for
he was put above all the musicians, and he had servants tending upon him,
and
everything to his heart's content, and a hearty welcome to all; and, in
short,
he was made as much of as if he had been the first man in the land. 
Presently Lusmore saw a great consultation going forward among the
fairies, and,
notwithstanding all their civility, he felt very much frightened, until
one
stepping out from the rest came up to him and said:
 
Lusmore! Lusmore! 
Doubt not, nor deplore, 
For the hump which you bore 
On your back is no more; 
Look down on the floor, And view it, Lusmore! 
 
When these words were said, poor little Lusmore felt himself so light, and
so
happy, that he thought he could have bounded at one jump over the moon,
like the
cow in the history of the cat and the fiddle; and he saw, with
inexpressible
pleasure, his hump tumble down upon the ground from his shoulders.  He
then
tried to lift up his head, and he did so with becoming caution, fearing
that he
might knock it against the ceiling of the grand hall, where he was; he
looked
round and round again with greatest wonder and delight upon everything,
which
appeared more and more beautiful; and, overpowered at beholding such a
resplendent scene, his head grew dizzy, and his eyesight became dim. 
At last he fell into a sound sleep, and when he awoke he found that it was
broad
daylight, the sun shining brightly, and the birds singing sweetly; and
that he
was lying just at the foot of the moat of Knockgrafton, with the cows and
sheep
grazing peacefully round about him.  The first thing Lusmore did, after
saying
his prayers, was to put his hand behind to feel for his hump, but no sign
of one
was there on his back, and he looked at himself with great pride, for he
had now
become a well-shaped dapper little fellow, and more than that, found
himself in
a full suit of new clothes, which he concluded the fairies had made for
him. 
Towards Cappagh he went, stepping out as lightly, and springing up at
every step
as if he had been all his life a dancing-master.  Not a creature who met
Lusmore
knew him without his hump, and he had a great work to persuade every one
that he
was the same man -- in truth he was not, so far as outward appearance
went. 
Of course it was not long before the story of Lusmore's hump got about,
and a
great wonder was made of it.  Through the country, for miles round, it was
the
talk of every one, high and low. 
One morning, as Lusmore was sitting contented enough, at his cabin door,
up came
an old woman to him, and asked him if he could direct her to Cappagh. 
"I need give you no directions, my good woman," said Lusmore, "for this is
Cappagh; and whom may you want here?" 
"I have come," said the woman," out of Decie's country, in the county of
Waterford looking after one Lusmore, who, I have heard tell, had his hump
taken
off by the fairies; for there is a son of a gossip of mine who has got a
hump on
him that will be his death; and maybe if he could use the same charm as
Lusmore,
the hump may be taken off him.  And now I have told you the reason of my
coming
so far: 'tis to find out about this charm, if I can." 
Lusmore, who was ever a good-natured little fellow, told the woman all the
particulars, how he had raised the tune for the fairies at Knockgrafton,
how his
hump had been removed from his shoulders, and how he had got a new suit of
clothes into the bargain. 
The woman thanked him very much, and then went away quite happy and easy
in her
own mind.  When she came back to her gossip's house, in the county of
Waterford,
she told her everything that Lusmore had said, and they put the little
hump-backed man, who was a peevish and cunning creature from his birth,
upon a
car, and took him all the way across the country.  It was a long journey,
but
they did not care for that, so the hump was taken from off him; and they
brought
him, just at nightfall, and left him under the old moat of
Knockgrafton. 
Jack Madden, for that was the humpy man's name, had not been sitting there
long
when he heard the tune going on within the moat much sweeter than before;
for
the fairies were singing it the way Lusmore had settled their music for
them,
and the song was going on; "Da Luan, Da Mort, Da Luan, Da Mort, Da Luan,
Da
Mort, augus Da Cadine," without ever stopping. 
Jack Madden, who was in a great hurry to get quit of his hump, never
thought of
waiting until the fairies had done, or watching for a fit opportunity to
raise
the tune higher again than Lusmore had; so having heard them sing it over
seven
times without stopping, out he bawls, never minding the time or the humor
of the
tune, or how he could bring his words in properly, augus Da Cadine, augus
Da
Hena, thinking that if one day was good, two were better; and that if
Lusmore
had one new suit of clothes given him, he should have two. 
No sooner had the words passed his lips than he was taken up and whisked
into
the moat with prodigious force; and the fairies came crowding round about
him
with great anger, screeching, and screaming, and roaring out, "Who spoiled
our
tune? who spoiled our tune?" and one stepped up to him, above all the rest
and
said: 
 
Jack Madden!  Jack Madden! 
Your words came so bad in 
The tune we felt glad in; 
This castle you're had in, 
That your life we may sadden; 
Here's two humps for Jack Madden! 
 
And twenty of the strongest fairies brought Lusmore's hump and put it down
upon
poor Jack's back, over his own, where it became fixed as firmly as if it
was nailed on with twelve-penny nails, by the best carpenter that ever drove
one. Out of their castle they then kicked him; and, in the morning, when Jack
Madden's mother and her gossip came to look after their little man, they
found him half dead, lying at the foot of the moat, with the other hump upon his
back.  Well to be sure, how they did look at each other!  But they were afraid
to say anything, lest a hump might be put upon their own shoulders.  Home they
brought the unlucky Jack Madden with them, as downcast in their hearts and their
looks as ever two gossips were; and what through the weight of his other hump,
and the long journey, he died soon after, leaving they say his heavy curse to
anyone who would go to listen to fairy tunes again.
