In the year 1453 a terrifying judgment of God happened in the Istrian town of Motovun. An evil and undisciplined son had a good, old father who was very poor. He often had neither bread nor wine at home, and no one gave him alms.  
Sometimes he would go to his son and knock on the door.  
His son's wife would say, "Look, it's your father." 
The son would answer, "What in the devil's name does he want? Let him in and give him a little bread and some watered wine like they give to children."  
Thus it happened several times, and the old man patiently accepted this treatment.  
One day the son bought a good capon. They prepared it and sat down at the table to eat while it was still warm.  
The mean-spirited wife, prompted by the devil, said, "If only your father won't come by just now!"  
The son said, "I hope that we can eat the capon without being disturbed."  
Suddenly someone knocked on the door. The son looked out -- it was his father.  
"Curses that just now I have to open the door for him!" said the son. 
He quickly hid the capon in a chest. He gave the poor old man a little bread and cheese and a little wine, told him to eat quickly, and then sent him home.  
The father had scarcely left when the son went to the chest to fetch the capon. He lifted the lid. A large, terrible toad jumped out and into the son's face. Neither physicians nor medications could free him from it. The toad ate away his entire face so that he no longer could show himself to anyone.
