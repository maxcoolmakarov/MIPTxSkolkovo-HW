A farmer fell into poverty because he could not keep any cows in his 
stalls, the necks of all having been broken one after another. He 
therefore left the farm, which was sold to another. When the new 
proprietor came into the cowshed one evening and saw that everything was 
in a dubious state, he exclaimed, "Good evening, Raginal!"   
Whereupon a voice answered, "What? Do you know me?"   
"Yes, I have known you for many a year!"   
"If," said the troll, who dwelled beneath, "you will move your cowshed to 
some other place, you shall become a wealthy man. I have my habitation 
under the cows, and their filth falls down on my table every day, so that 
I have been obliged to break their necks."   
The man removed the cowshed, and thrived from that time.
