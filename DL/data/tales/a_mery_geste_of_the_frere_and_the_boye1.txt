Here Begynneth A Mery Geste of the Frere and the Boye
 
God that deyde ffor vs all,  
And dranke eysell and gall,  
Brynge vs out of bale,  
Ang gyue them good lyfe and long  
That lysteneth to my songe,  
Or tendeth to my tale.  
Ther was a man in my countre  
That had wyues thre,  
Be proseys of tyme,  
Bey the fyrst wyfe a sone he had,  
That was a hapey ladde,  
And a partey hyne.   
His fader loued hym wele,  
So dyde his moder neuer a dele,  
I tell yow as I thinke;  
Sche thowth lost, he the rode,  
That dyde the boye ony good,  
Other mete or drynke.   
And yet y wys it was but badde,  
Nor halffe ynowh therof he had,   
Oft he was afforst:   
Therfore euyll mote she fare,  
Ofte she dyde the lytell boye care,  
As ferforth as she dorste.   
The good wyfe to her hushonde gan saye;  
I wolde ye wolde put this boye awaye,  
And that ryght soone in haste;  
Truly he is a cursed ladde,  
I wolde some other man hym had,  
That wolde hym hetter chaste.   
Then sayd the good man agayne:   
Dame, I shall to the sayne,   
He is but tender of age;   
He shall abyde with me this yere,   
Tyll he he more strongere,   
For to wynne better wage.   
We haue a man, a stoute freke,   
That in the felde kepeth our nete,   
He slepys all the daye,  
He shall come home, so god me shelde,   
And the boye shall into the felde,   
To kepe our beestes, yf he may.   
Than sayd the wyfe, verament:   
Sere, therto I assent,   
I holde het be the beste.   
On the morowe, whan it was daye,   
The lytell boye wente on his waye,   
To the ffellde full prest;   
Of no man he had no care,   
But sung, hey howe, awaye the mare,   
And made ioye ynough.   
Fforet he wente, truly to sayne,  
Tyll he came to the playne,  
Hys dyner foret he drough.  
Whan he sawe, it was bad,  
Lytell lust therto he had,  
But put it yp agayne;   
Therfore he was not to wyte,  
He sayd he wolde ete but lyte,  
Tyll nyght that he home came.   
And as the boye sate on a hill,  
An olde man came hym tyll,  
Walkynge by the waye:  
Sone, he sayde, god the se.  
Syr, welcome mote ye be  
The lytell boye gan saye.   
The olde man sayd: I honger sore,  
Hast thou ony mete in store,  
That thou mayst gyue me?   
The chylde sayd: so god me saue,   
To such vytayle as I haue  
Welcome shall ye be.   
Therof the olde man was gladde,  
The boye drewe forth suche as he had,  
And made him ryght merry.   
The olde man was easy to please,  
He ete, and made hym well at ease,  
And sayd: sone, gramercy.   
Ffor they mete that thou hast geffe me   
I shall gyue the thynges thre,   
Thou shalt them not forgete.  
The boye seyde: het is best I trowe,   
Ffor me to haue a bowe,  
At byrdes for to shete.   
A bowe, sone, I shall the gyue,  
That shall last the all thy lyue,  
And euer a lyke mete,  
Shote therin, whan thou good thynke,  
For yf thou shote, and wynke,   
The prycke thow shalte hytte.   
Whan he the howe in honde felte,   
And the boltes vnder his belte,  
Lowde than he lough;  
He sayd: now had I a pype,  
Though it were neuer so lyte,  
Than were I gladde ynough.   
A pype thou shalte haue also,  
In true musyke it shall go,  
I put thee out of doubt;  
All that may the pype here   
Shall not themselfe stere,  
But laugh and lepe aboute.  
What shall the thyrde be?   
Gyfftes I schall geve the three.  
As I haue sayd before.  
The lytell boye on hym lough,  
And sayd: syr, I haue ynough,  
I wyll desyre no more.   
The olde man sayd: my trouth I plyght,  
Thou shalte haue that I the hyght;  
Say on now, and let me se.   
Than sayd the boye anone:  
I haue a stepdame at home,  
She is a shrewe to me:  
Whan my fader gyueth me awth,  
Be God that me dere bowth,   
Sche stareth me in the face;  
Whan she loketh on me so,  
I wolde she sholde let a rappe go,  
That myght rynge ouer all the place.   
Than sayd the olde man tho:  
Whan she loketh on the so,  
She shall begyn to blowe;  
All that euer it may here  
Shall not themselfe stere,  
But dans on a rowe.   
Farewell, quod the olde man.  
God kepe the, sayd the chylde than,  
I take my leue at the;  
God, that moost best may, iso  
Kepe the bothe nyght and day.  
Gramercy, sone, sayd he.   
Than drewe it towarde the nyght,  
Iacke hym hyed home full ryght,  
It was his ordynaunce;   
He toke his pype, and began to blowe;  
All his beestes on a rowe  
Aboute hym they can daunce.   
Thus wente he pypynge thrugh the towne,  
His beestes hym folowed by the sowne   
Into his faders close;  
He wente, and put them vp echone,  
Homewarde he wente anone;  
Into the hall he gose;  
His fader at his souper sat;  
Lytell Iacke espyed well that,  
And sayd to hym anone:  
Fader, I haue kepte your nete,  
I praye you gyue me some mete,  
I am an hongred, by Saynt Ihone.   
I have sytten metelesse  
All this daye kepynge your beestes,  
My dyner feble it was.  
His fader toke a capons wynge,  
And at the boye he gan it flynge,  
And badde hym ete apace.   
That greued his Dames herte sore,  
As I tolde you before;  
She stared hym in the face,  
With that she let go a blaste,   
That all in the hall were agaste,  
It range ouer all the place.   
All they laughed, and had good game,  
The wyfe waxed red for shame,  
She wolde that she had ben gone.   
Quod the boye: well I wote,  
That gonne was well shote,  
As it had ben a stone.   
Cursedly she loked on hym tho;  
Another blaste she let go,   
She was almoost rente.  
Quod the boye: wyll ye se  
How my dame letteth pellettes fle,  
In fayth or euer she stynte!   
The boye sayde vnto his dame:  
Tempre thy bombe, he sayd, for shame:  
She was full of sorowe.   
Dame, sayd the good man, go thy waye:  
For I swere to the, by my faye,  
Thy gere is not to borowe.   
Afterwarde, as ye shall here.   
To the hous ther came a frere,  
To lye there all nyght;  
The wyfe loued him as a saynt,  
And to hym made her complaynt,  
And tolde hym all aryght.   
Wee haue a boye within ywys,  
A shrewe for the nones he is,  
He dooth me moche care;  
I dare not loke hym vpon:   
I am ashamed, by Saynt Iohn,  
To tell yow how I fare.   
I praye you mete the boye tomorowe,  
Bete hym well, and gyue hym sorowe,  
And make the boye lame.   
Quod the frere: I shall hym bete.  
Quod the wyfe: do not forgete,  
He dooth to me moche shame:  
I trowe the boye be some wytche.   
Quod the frere: I shall hym teche,   
Haue thou therof no care;  
I shall hym teche, yf I may.   
Quod the wyfe: I the praye,  
Do hym not spare.   
On the morowe the boye arose,  
Into the felde soone he gose,  
His beestes for to dryue;  
The frere ranne out at the gate,  
He was a ferde leest he came to late,  
He ranne fast and blyue.   
Whan he came vpon the londe,  
Lytell Iacke there he fonde,  
Dryuynge his beestes all alone;  
Boye, he sayd, god gyue the shame,   
What hast thou done to thy dame,  
Tell thou me anone?   
But yf thou canst excuse the well,  
By my trouth bete the I wyll,  
I will no lenger abyde.   
Quod the boye: what eyleth the?  
My dame fareth as well as ye,  
What nedeth ye to chyde?  
Quod the boye: wyll ye wete  
How I can a byrde shete,  
And other thynge withall?   
Syr, he sayd, though I be lyte,  
Yonder byrde wyll I smyte,  
And gyue her the I shall.  
There sate a byrde vpon a brere,  
Shote on, boy, quod the frere,   
For that me lysteth to se.   
He hytte the byrde on the heed,  
That she fell downe deed,  
No ferder myght she flee.  
The frere to the busshe wente,  
Vp the byrde for to hente,  
He thought it best for to done.   
Iacke toke his pype, and began to blowe,  
Then the frere, as I trowe,  
Began to daunce soone.   
As soone as he the pype herd,  
Lyke a wood man he fared,  
He lepte and daunced aboute;  
The breres scratched hym in the face,  
And in many an other place,  
That the blode brast out;  
And tare his clothes by and by,  
His cope and his scapelary,  
And all his other wede.   
He daunced amonge the thornes thycke,   
In many places they dyde hym prycke,  
That fast gan he blede.  
Iacke pyped and laughed amonge,  
The frere amonge the thornes was thronge,  
He hopped wunderous hye;   
At the last he held vp his honde,  
And sayd: I haue daunced so longe,  
That I am lyke to dye;  
Gentyll Iacke, holde thy pype styll,  
And by my trouth I plyght the tyll,   
I will do the no woo.   
Iacke sayd in that tide:  
Frere, skyppe out on the ferder syde,  
Lyghtly that thou were goo.   
The frere out of the busshe wente,  
All to ragged and to rente,  
And torne on euery syde;  
Unnethes on hym he had one cloute,  
His bely for to wrappe aboute;  
His harneys for to hyde.   
The breres had hym scratched in the face,  
And in many an other place,  
He was all to bledde with blode ;  
All that myght the frere se,  
Were fayne awaye to flee,  
They wende he had ben wode.   
Whan he came to his hoost,  
Of his ionrney he made no boost,  
His clothes were rente all;  
Moche sorowe in his herte he had,   
And euery man hym dradde,  
Whan he came in to the hall.   
The wyfe sayd: where hast thou bene?  
In an euyll place, I wene,  
Me thynketh by thyn araye.  
Dame, I haue ben with thy sone,  
The deuyll of hell hym ouercome:  
For no man elles may.   
With that came in the good man,  
The wife sayd unto hym than:   
Here is a foule araye;  
Thy sone, that is thy lefe and dere,  
Hath almoost slayne this holy frere,  
Alas, and welawaye.   
The good man sayd:  benedicite!   
What hath the boye done, frere, to the,  
Tell me without lette?  
The frere sayd: the deuyll hym spode,  
He hath made me daunce, maugro my hede,  
Amonge the thornes, hey go bette.   
The good man sajd to hym tho:  
Haddest thou lost thy lyfe so,  
It had ben grete synne.  
The frere sayd: by our lady,  
The pype went so meryly,  
That I coude neuer blynne.  
Whan it drewe towarde the nyght,  
The boye came home full ryght,  
As he was wont to do.   
Whan he came into the hall,   
Soone his fader gan hym call,  
And badde hym come hym to.  
Boye, he sayd, tell me here,  
What hast thou done unto the frere,  
Tell me without lesynge?   
Fader, he sayd, by my faye,  
I dydo nought elles, as I yow saye,  
But pyped him a sprynge.   
That pype, sayd his fader, wolde I here.   
Mary, god forbede, sayd the frere:   
His handes he dyde wrynge.  
Yes, sayd the good man, by goddes grace.  
Then, sayd the frere, out alas,  
And made grete mournynge.   
For the loue of god, quod the frere.  
If ye wyll that pype here,  
Bynde me to a post:  
For I knowe none other rede,  
And I daunce, I am but deed,  
Well I wote my lyfe is lost.   
Stronge ropes they toke in honde,  
The frere to the poste they bonde,  
In the myddle of the halle.  
All that at the souper sat   
Laughed and had good game therat,  
And said, the frere wolde not fall.   
Than sayd the good man:  
Pype, sonne, as thou can,  
Hardely whan thou wylle.   
Fader, he sayd, so mote I the,   
Haue ye shall ynough of gle,  
Tyll ye bydde me be styll.   
As soon as Iacke the pype hent,  
All that there were, verament,  
Began to daunce and lepe;  
Whan they gan the pype here,  
They myght not themselfe stere,  
But hurled on an hepe.   
The good man was in no dyspayre,  
But lyghtly lepte out of his chayre,   
All with a goodly chere;  
Some lepte ouer the stocke;  
Some stombled at the blocke:  
And some fell flatte in the fyre.   
The good man had grete game,  
How they daunced all in same;   
The good wyfe after gan steppe;  
Euermore she kest her eye at Iacke,  
And fast her tayle began to cracke,   
Lowder than they coude speke.   
The frere hymselfe was almoost lost,  
For knockynge his heed ayenst the post,  
He had none other grace;  
The rope rubbed hym vnder the chynne,  
That the blode downe dyde rynne,  
In many a dyuers place.   
Iacke ranne into the strete,  
After hym fast dyde they lepe,  
Truly they coude not stynte;  
They wente out at the dore so theke,   
That eche man fell on others necke,  
So pretely out they wente.   
Neyghbours that were fast by,  
Herde the pype go so meryly,  
They ranne into the gate;  
Some lepte ouer the hatche,  
They had no time to drawe the latche,  
They wende they had come to late.   
Some laye in theyr bedde,  
And helde vp theyr hede,   
Anone they were waked;  
Some sterte in the waye,  
Truly as I you saye,  
Stark bely naked.   
By that they were gradred aboute,  
I wys there was a grete route,  
Dauncynge in the strete;  
Some were lame, and myght not go,  
But yet ywys they daunced allso,  
On handes and on fete.   
The boye sayd: now wyll I rest.  
Quod the good man: I holde it best,  
With a mery chere;  
Sease, sone, whan thou wylte,  
In fayth this is the meryest fytte  
That I herde this seuen yere.   
They daunced all in same.  
Some laughed, and had good game,  
And some had many a fall.   
Thou cursed boye, quod the frere,   
Here I somon the that thou appere  
Before the offycyall;  
Loke thou be there on Frydaye,  
I wyll the mete and I may,  
For to ordeyne the sorowe.   
The boye sayd: by god auowe,  
Frere, I am as redy as thou,  
And Frydaye were to morowe.   
Frydaye came, as ye may here;  
Iackes stepdame and the frere   
Togeder there they mette;  
Folke gadered a grete pase,  
To here euery mannes case,  
The offycyall was sette.   
There was moche to do,  
Maters more than one or two,  
Both with preest and clerke.   
Some had testamentes for to preue,  
And fayre women, by your leue,  
That had strokes in the derke.  
Euery man put forth his case,  
Then came forth frere Topyas,  
And Iackes stepdame also.   
Sir offycyall, sayd he,  
I haue brought a boye to thee,  
Which hath wrought me moche wo;  
He is a grete nygromancere,  
In all Orlyaunce is not his pere,  
As by my trouth I trowe.   
He is a wytche, quod the wyfe:   
Than, as I shall tell you blythe,  
Lowde coude she blowe.  
Some laughed without fayle,  
Some sayd: dame, tempre thy tayle,  
Ye wreste it all amysse.   
Dame, quod the offycyall,  
Tel forth on thy tale,  
Lette not for all this.  
The wyfe was afrayed of an other cracke,  
That no wordo more she spacke,  
She durst not for drede.   
The frere sayd: so mote I the,  
Knaue, this is long of the  
That euyl mote thou spede.  
The frere sayd: syr offycyall,  
The boye wyll combre vs all,  
But yf ye may him chaste;  
Syr, he hath a pype truly,  
Wyll make you daunce, and lepe on hye,  
Tyll your herte braste.   
The offycyall sayd: so mot I the,  
That pype wolde I fayne se,   
And knowe what myrth that he can make.   
Mary, god forbede, than sayd the frere,  
That he sholde pype here,  
Afore that I hens the waye take.  
Pype on, Iacke, sayd the offycyall,  
I wyll here now how thou canst playe.  
Iacke blewe vp, the sothe to saye,  
And made them soone to daunce all.   
The offycyall lepte ouer the deske,  
And daunced aboute wonder faste,  
Tyll bothe his shynnes he all to brest,  
Hym thought it was not of the best,  
Than cryed he vnto the chylde,  
To pype no more within this place,  
But to holde styll, for goddes grace,  
And for the loue of Mary mylde.   
Than sayd Iacke to them echone:  
If ye wolde me graunte with herte fre,   
That they shall do me no vylany,  
But hens to departe euen as I come.  
Therto they answered all anone,  
And promysed him anone ryght,  
In his quarell for to fyght,  
And defende hym from his fone.   
Thus they departed in that tyde,  
The offycyall and the sompnere,  
His stepdame and the frere,  
With great ioye and moche pryde.  
 
Thus endeth the Frere and ye Boye. Enprynted at London in Flete strete at the sygne of the sonne by Wynkyn de Worde.
