The servant of Landholder Gireck (whose residence in Plau was on Elden
Street where Master Mason BÃ¼ttner's house now stands) was once
hauling a load of manure to a field abutting Gall Mountain. He had just
unloaded the manure and was about to put the sideboards back onto the
wagon when he heard his name being called from the mountain, together with
the words, "When you get home say that Prilling and Pralling is dead."
Back at home, he had scarcely related this experience and repeated the
words, when they heard groaning and crying coming from the house's cellar.
They investigated, but found nothing but a pewter mug, of a kind that had
never before been seen in Plau. The master of the house kept the mug, and
when he later moved to Hamburg he took it with him. About seventy years
ago someone from Plau saw it there.
