In the Dakhan lived a Brahman who had
two wives. To the elder of these a son was
born.   
When the son was about ten months
old, the old Brahman set out with his family on
a pilgrimage to Benares [Varanasi], but he unfortunately
died on his way.   
The two women thereupon
"went to an adjacent  agraharam  (the Brahmans'
quarters in a city or village), and remained
there, rearing the boy with great affection, so
much so that the child knew not which of the
two was his real mother.   
But one day the younger lady quarrelled with the elder,
and, declaring that she would no longer
remain with her, took the child and set out to
go home.   
The elder thereupon seized the child
and demanded of the other why she was taking
him away.   
The younger replied that as she
had borne the child she was going away with
him.   
So the two still disputing went to the
Judge and told their story. He reflected a
little, called his servants and ordered them
to divide the child in twain and to give each
a half.   
The younger lady remained silent, but
the elder, being the real mother, was of opinion
that so long as the child did but live it
was enough; and, not consenting the Judge's
proposal, said to him that the child was not
her own, and requested him to give it to the
other lady.   
The Judge, hearing these words,
decided that the elder lady was the child's
mother, and had the boy given to her.
