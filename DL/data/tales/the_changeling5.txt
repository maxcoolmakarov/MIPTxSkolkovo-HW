Legends from the Iglau Language Island [in 
Moravia]  
An old midwife related this, so it must be true.  Until a child is 
baptized, mysterious beings attempt to steal it and put a changeling in 
its place.  Such a changeling has a large head with coal-black hair and a 
small body with thin legs, which do not learn to walk.  When this 
misfortune occurs, one must beat the changeling without mercy until the 
thief returns the right child.
  
A woman had laid her as yet unbaptized baby in a canopied bed.  The 
cherries had just ripened, and the red, tempting fruit was beckoning 
through the window from the garden.  The new mother could not resist, and 
went outside to pick a few cherries.  She had scarcely crossed the 
threshold when she was overcome by anxiety for her slumbering child, and 
she quickly returned.  There was, in fact, a being standing next to the 
bed.  The woman cried out and the being disappeared.  The imprint of its 
horrible paw, where it had grabbed for the child, could still be seen on 
the canopied bed.
