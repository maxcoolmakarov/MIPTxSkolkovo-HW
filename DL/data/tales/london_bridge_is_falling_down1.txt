London Bridge is falling down, etc., 
 My fair lady! 
How shall we build it up again? --  
Build it up with lime and stone. --  
Stone and lime would wash away. --  
Build it up with iron bars. --  
Iron bars would bend and break. --  
Build it up with gold and silver. --  
Gold and silver would be stole away. --  
Get a watch to watch all night. --  
Suppose the watch should fall asleep? --  
Get him a pipe to smoke all night. --  
Suppose the pipe should fall and break? --  
Get a dog to bark all night. --  
Suppose the dog should get a bone? --  
Get a cock to crow all night. --  
Suppose the cock should fly away? --  
What has this poor prisoner done? --  
He's broke my box and stole my keys. --  
A hundred pounds will set him free. --  
A hundred pounds he has not got. --  
Off to prison he must go. --  
 My fair lady!
