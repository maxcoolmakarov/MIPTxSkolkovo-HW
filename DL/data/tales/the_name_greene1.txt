It is said that in ancient times they once sacrificed a child on the
mountain above Greene.  It is no longer known what the occasion was.  The
child grinned beneath the butcher-knife, and one of the executioners said:
"It is still grinning!"  (Es greint noch!)  From that they named the place
that was soon built at that location "Greine" or "Greene."
