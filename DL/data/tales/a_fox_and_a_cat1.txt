There was a question started betwixt a fox and a cat, which of the two could make the best shift in the world, if they were put to a pinch.  
"For my own part," says Reynard, "when the worst comes to the worst, I have a whole budget of tricks to come off with at last."  
At that very instant, up comes a pack of dogs full-cry toward them. The cat presently takes a tree, and sees the poor fox torn to pieces upon the very spot.  
"Well," says Puss to herself, "one sure trick, I find, is better than a hundred slippery ones." 
The Moral: 
Nature has provided better for us, than we could have done for ourselves.
