Once upon a time there was a lion, who used
daily to devour one of the beasts of the
forest. They had to come up one after
another, when called for. At last it came to
the hare's turn to be eaten, and he did not
want to be eaten at all. He lingered and
he dallied, and when at last he plucked up
courage to come, he was very late. The lion,
when he saw the hare coming, bounded
towards him.   
The hare said, "Uncle Lion, I know I am late, and you have
cause to be angry. But really it is not my fault.
There is another lion in our part of the jungle, and
he says that he is master, and you are nobody. In
fact, when I showed him that I positively would come
to you he was very angry."
 
"Ha!" said the lion, roaring. "Who says he is my
master? Show him to me. I'll teach him who rules
the forest."
 
"Come along then," said the hare.
 
They went a long way, until they came to a well.
The hare looked down into the well. 
 
"He was here just now," said he.
  
The Lion looked in, and at the bottom he saw
what looked like a lion in the water. He shook his
mane -- the other lion shook his mane. He roared
 -- the echo of a roar came up from the bottom of the well. 
 
"Let me get at him!" roared the lion. 
 
In he jumped -- splash! Nothing more was ever heard of
that lion, and the beasts of the forest were glad to
be left in peace. They put their heads together, and
composed a verse of poetry, which is always sung in
that forest on Sundays:
 
The hare is small, but by his wit  
He now has got the best of it;  
By folly down the lion fell,  
And lost his life within the well.
