Springs and wells of water have, in all lands and in all ages, been
greatly
valued, and in some regarded with a feeling of veneration little, if at
all, short of worship. 
They have yielded their treasure to the sustenance and refreshment of man
and beast, as age after age of the world's history has passed along, and have
been centers around which village story and gossip have gathered for generation
after generation.  Little wonder, therefore, is it that legends and traditions
abound concerning them.  These are often extremely local, and therefore little
known. 
The names alone, however, suggest much.  The memory of the mythical gods,
satyrs, and nymphs of the ancient heathen times lingers in a few, as in
Thors-kil or Thors-well, in the parish of Burnsall; and in the almost
universal declaration -- by which not over-wise parents seek to deter children from
playing in dangerous proximity to a well -- that at the bottom, under the
water, dwells a mysterious being, usually named Jenny Green-teeth or
Peg-o'-the-Well, who will certainly drag into the water any child who approaches too near to it. 
The tokens of medieval reverence for wells are abundant.  The names of the
saints to whom the wells were dedicated yet cling to them.  "There is
scarcely a well of consequence in the United Kingdom," says the editor of
 Lancashire Folk-lore , "which has not been solemnly dedicated to some saint in the Roman calendar."  
Thus in Yorkshire we have Our Lady's Well or Lady Well, St. Helen's Well
(very numerous), St. Margaret's Well at Burnsall, St. Bridget's Well near Ripon,
St. Mungo's Well at Copgrove, St. John's Well at Beverley, St. Alkelda's Well
at Middleham, etc.  Dr. Whitaker remarks that the wells of Craven, which bear
the names of saints, are invariably presided over by females, as was the case
with wells under the pagan ritual, in which nymphs exclusively enjoyed the same
honor.
