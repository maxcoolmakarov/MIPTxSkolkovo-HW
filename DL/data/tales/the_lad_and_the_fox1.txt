There was once upon a time a little lad, who was on his way to church,
and when he came to a clearing in the forest he caught sight of a fox, who
was lying on the top of a big stone fast asleep, so that the fox did not
know the lad had seen him. 
 "If I kill that fox," said the lad, taking a heavy stone in his fist,
"and sell the skin, I shall get money for it, and with that money I shall
buy some rye, and that rye I shall sow in father's cornfield at home. When
the people who are on their way to church pass by my field of rye they'll
say, 'Oh, what splendid rye that lad has got!' Then I shall say to them,
'I say, keep away from my rye!' But they won't heed me. Then I shall shout
to them, 'I say, keep away from my rye!' But still they won't take any
notice of me. Then I shall scream with all my might, 'Keep away from my
rye!' and then they'll listen to me." 
 But the lad screamed so loudly that the fox woke up and made off at
once for the forest, so that the lad did not even get as much as a handful
of his hair. 
 No, it's best always to take what you can reach, for of undone deeds
you should never screech, as the saying goes.
