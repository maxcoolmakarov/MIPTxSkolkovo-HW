On the main road from Nenndorf to Hannover in the vicinity of the
village of Eberloh, right next to the road, there can be seen seven
upright stones spaced like footsteps.  They have been carefully preserved
even to this day.  They are called the seven steps, and the following
legend is associated with them:
 Many years ago two peasants came into conflict about the boundary
between their adjoining fields.  The one accused the other of plowing away
some of his land.  The accused man swore with an oath that he was
innocent.  Later the accuser wanted to prove that his neighbor had
perjured himself, and invited the court to see the fields for themselves.
 The person who had sworn the oath appeared as well, and said, "If I
have sworn falsely then may God grant that I take no more than seven
steps."  With his seventh step he disappeared, and was never seen again.
