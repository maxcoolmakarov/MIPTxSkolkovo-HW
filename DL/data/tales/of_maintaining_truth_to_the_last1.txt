In the reign of Gordian, there was a certain noble soldier who had
a fair but vicious wife. It happened that her husband having occasion to
travel, the lady sent for her gallant. Now, one of her handmaids, it
seems, was skillful in interpreting the song of birds; and in the court of
the castle there were three cocks. During the night, while the gallant was
with his mistress, the first cock began to crow.  
 The lady heard it, and said to her servant, "Dear friend, what says
yonder cock?" 
 She replied, "That you are grossly injuring your husband." 
 "Then," said the lady, "kill that cock without delay." 
 They did so. But soon after, the second cock crew, and the lady
repeated her question. 
 "Madam," said the handmaid, "he says, 'My companion died for revealing
the truth, and for the same cause, I am prepared to die.'" 
 "Kill him," cried the lady, which they did. 
 After this, the third cock crew. 
 "What says he?" asked she again. 
 "Hear, see, and say nothing, if you would live in peace." 
 "Oh, oh!" said the lady. " Don't  kill him." And her orders were
obeyed. 
 
 Application 
 My beloved, the emperor is God; the soldier, Christ; and the
wife, the soul. The gallant is the devil. The handmaid is conscience. The
first cock is our Savior, who was put to death; the second is the martyrs;
and the third is a preacher who ought to be earnest in declaring the
truth, but, being deterred by menaces, is afraid to utter it.
