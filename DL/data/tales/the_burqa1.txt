Nasreddin Hodja's first marriage was an arranged marriage, and in 
keeping with the custom of the time, he did not see his unveiled bride 
until the wedding ceremony. Unfortunately, she did not have an attractive 
face.  
 The next day when the bride was making preparations to go to market, 
she asked her husband, as was the custom, "Shall I wear my burqa? I do not 
wish to show my face to anyone against your wishes."  
 Nasreddin answered, "Wear your burqa or leave it at home. It is all the 
same to me to whom you show your face in public. All I ask is that you 
keep your face covered when you are at home with me."
