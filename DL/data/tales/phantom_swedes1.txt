German Legends and Customs in the Hessian Districts 
 
Since the Thirty Years' War, the Swedes have lived in dreadful memory 
along the Kinzig River.  "Swede," like "Croat," is a bad curse word, and 
there are stories of male and female phantom Swedes as harmful beings and 
evil sorcerers.
  
In Steinau, a woman, carrying her year and a half old boy on her arm, 
came upon the Phantom Swedish Woman while walking across the street in 
broad daylight.  The latter grabbed the child and made it disappear.  She 
told the grieving mother to go back home, where she would find her child 
in his bed.  Seized by a deathly fear, the woman hurried home.  In the 
bed she saw a howling, ugly changeling, a boy with an extremely thick 
head.  With time the boy grew up, but he remained mentally retarded.
