Table Talk 
A father, now aged, had given over all his property to his children, with the understanding that they would care for him as long as he lived. But they were thankless and soon grew tired of him.  Considering him a nuisance, they gave him but little to eat.  
The father, who was an intelligent man, locked himself in a room, and as though he were counting out a large sum of money, made a ringing sound with some guilder that his neighbor had lent him.  The children heard this and thereafter treated him with honor, hoping that he would leave this money to them.   
He returned the borrowed coins to his neighbor.   
When he died the children discovered that they had been deceived.
