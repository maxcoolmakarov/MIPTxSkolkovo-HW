There was a horse-man had a cap on with a false head of hair tack'd to'it. There comes a puff of wind, and blows off cap and wig together. The people made sport, he saw, with his bald crown, and so very fairly he put in with them to laugh for company.   
"Why, gentlemen," says he, "would you have me keep other people's hair better than I did my own?"  
 The Moral: Many a man would be extreamly ridiculous, if he did not spoil the jest by playing upon himself first.
