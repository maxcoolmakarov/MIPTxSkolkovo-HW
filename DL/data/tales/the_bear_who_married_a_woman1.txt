Once upon a time there lived a widow of the tribe of the
Gispaxl√¢'ts. Many men tried to marry her daughter, but she declined
them all.
 The mother said, "When a man comes to marry you, feel of the palms of
his hands. If they are soft, decline him. If they are rough, accept him."
She meant that she wanted to have for a son-in-law a man skillful in
building canoes.
 Her daughter obeyed her commands and refused the wooings of all young
men. One night a youth came to her bed. The palms of his hands were very
rough, and therefore she accepted his suit. Early in the morning, however,
he had suddenly disappeared, even before she had seen him.
 When her mother arose early in the morning and went out, she found a
halibut on the beach in front of the house, although it was midwinter. The
following evening the young man came back, but disappeared again before
the dawn of the day. In the morning the widow found a seal in front of the
house. Thus they lived for some time. The young woman never saw the face
of her husband; but every morning she found an animal on the beach, every
day a larger one. Thus the widow came to be very rich.
 She was anxious to see her son-in-law, and one day she waited until he
arrived. Suddenly she saw a red bear emerge from the water. He carried a
whale on each side, and put them down on the beach. As soon as he noticed
that he was observed, he was transformed into a rock, which may be seen up
to this day. He was a supernatural being of the sea.
