 Legends, Tales, and Customs from Mecklenburg  
It is said that the farmyard of Peasant LÃ¼th in Spornitz was 
formerly frequented by the underground people.  Once when the peasant had 
gone to town they exchanged his child for one of their own, one who had 
an enormously large head and who did not grow properly, but who otherwise 
was mentally all right.  In order to get their own child back, acting on 
the advice of a neighbor woman, the peasant's wife brewed beer in an 
eggshell.
  
As she was doing it, the child asked:  "What are you doing there?"
  
She answered:  "I'm brewing."
  
Then the child said:
 
 
I am as old  
As Bohemian gold,  
But in all my days I've never seen such brewing.
 
 
Then the woman said:  "I'll throw you in."  Then the child began to cry.  
The underground people heard it and brought her child back.
