One day a man who had been to gather his coconuts loaded his horse heavily
with
the fruit.  On the way home he met a boy whom he asked how long it would
take to
reach the house. 
"If you go slowly," said the boy, looking at the load on the horse, "you
will
arrive very soon; but if you go fast, it will take you all day." 
The man could not believe this strange speech, so he hurried his horse.
But the
coconuts fell off and he had to stop to pick them up.  Then he hurried his
horse
all the more to make up for lost time, but the coconuts fell off again.
Many
time he did this, and it was night when he reached home.
