For many years following the death of Emperor Napoleon it was believed in Strasbourg, and indeed throughout Alsace, 
that he had not died in St. Helena -- that this was a dishonest fabrication of his enemies. 
The people say that he is still alive and will return with the Moors and the Turks and then in new splendor 
and with new power ascend to his throne and rule the world.
