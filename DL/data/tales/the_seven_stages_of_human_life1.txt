Seven times in one verse did the author of Ecclesiastes make use of the
word  vanity , in allusion to the seven stages of human life. 
 The first commences in the first year of human existence, when the
 infant  lies like a king on a soft couch, with numerous attendants
about him, all ready to serve him, and eager to testify their love and
attachment by kisses and embraces. 
 The second commences about the age of two or three years, when the
darling  child  is permitted to crawl on the ground, and, like an
unclean animal, delights in dirt and filth. 
 Then at the age of ten, the thoughtless  boy , without reflecting
on the past or caring for the future, jumps and skips about like a young
kid on the enameled green, contented to enjoy the present moment. 
 The fourth stage begins about the age of twenty, when the  young
man , full of vanity and pride, begins to set off his person by dress;
and, like a young unbroken horse, prances and gallops about in search of a
wife. 
 Then comes the  matrimonial state , when the poor  man , like
a patient ass, is obliged, however reluctantly, to toil and labor for a
living. 
 Behold him now in the  parental state , when surrounded by
helpless children craving his support and looking to him for bread. He is
as bold, as vigilant, and as fawning, too, as the faithful dog; guarding
his little flock, and snatching at everything that comes in his way, in
order to provide for his offspring. 
 At last comes the final stage, when the decrepit  old man , like
the unwieldy though most sagacious elephant, becomes grave, sedate, and
distrustful. He then begins to hang down his head towards the ground, as
if surveying the place where all his vast schemes must terminate, and
where ambition and vanity are finally humbled to the dust.
