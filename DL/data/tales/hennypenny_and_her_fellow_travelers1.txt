A hen was picking at a stack of pea-straw when a pea fell on her head,
and she thought the sky was falling. And she thought she would go and tell
the king about it. And she went, and went, and went, and she met a
cock. 
 And he said, "Where are you going this day, Henny-Penny?" 
 And she says, "I'm going to tell the king the sky is falling." 
 And he says, "I'll go with you, Henny-Penny." 
 And they went, and they went, and they went. And they met a duck. And
the duck says, "Where are you going this day, Cocky-Locky,
Henny-Penny?" 
 "We're going to tell the king the sky is falling." 
 "I'll go with you, Cocky-Locky, Henny-Penny." 
 "Then come along, Ducky-Daddles." 
 And they went, and they went, and they went. And they met a goose. And
the goose says, "Where are you going this day, Ducky-Daddles, Cocky-Locky,
Henny-Penny?" 
 "We're going to tell the king the sky is falling." 
 And he says, "I'll go with you, Ducky-Daddles, Cocky-Locky,
Henny-Penny." 
 "Then come along, Goosie-Poosey," said they. 
 And they went, and they went, and they went, till they came to a wood,
and there they met a fox. And the fox says, "Where are you going this day,
Goosie-Poosey, Ducky-Daddles, Cocky-Locky, Henny-Penny?" 
 "We're going to tell the king the sky is falling." 
 And he says, "Come along, and I'll show you the road, Goosie-Poosey,
Ducky-Daddles, Cocky-Locky, Henny-Penny." 
 And they went, and they went, and they went, till they came to the
fox's hole. And he shoved them all in, and he and his young ones ate them
all up, and they never got to tell the king the sky was falling.
