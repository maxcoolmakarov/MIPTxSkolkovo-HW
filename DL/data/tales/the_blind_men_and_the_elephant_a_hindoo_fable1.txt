I.  
It was six men of Indostan   
To learning much inclined,   
Who went to see the Elephant   
 (Though all of them were blind),   
That each by observation   
Might satisfy his mind.    
II.   
The  First  approached the Elephant,   
And happening to fall   
Against his broad and sturdy side, At once began to bawl:   
"God bless me! -- but the Elephant   
Is very like a wall!"   
III.   
The  Second , feeling of the tusk,   
Cried: "Ho! -- what have we here   
So very round and smooth and sharp?   
To me 't is mighty clear   
This wonder of an Elephant   
Is very like a spear!"   
IV.   
The  Third  approached the animal,   
And happening to take   
The squirming trunk within his hands,   
Thus boldly up and spake:   
"I see," quoth he, "the Elephant   
Is very like a snake!"   
V.   
The  Fourth  reached out his eager hand,   
And felt about the knee.   
"What most this wondrous beast is like   
Is mighty plain," quoth he; "'T is clear enough the Elephant   
Is very like a tree!"   
VI.   
The  Fifth , who chanced to touch the ear,   
Said: "E'en the blindest man   
Can tell what this resembles most;   
Deny the fact who can,   
This marvel of an Elephant   
Is very like a fan!"   
VII.   
The  Sixth  no sooner had begun   
About the beast to grope,    
Than, seizing on the swinging tail   
That fell within his scope,   
"I see," quoth he, "the Elephant   
Is very like a rope!"   
VIII.   
And so these men of Indostan   
Disputed loud and long,   
Each in his own opinion   
Exceeding stiff and strong,   
Though each was partly in the right,   
And all were in the wrong.
  
MORAL.   
So, oft in theologic wars   
The disputants, I ween,   
Rail on in utter ignorance   
Of what each other mean,   
And prate about an Elephant   
Not one of them has seen!
