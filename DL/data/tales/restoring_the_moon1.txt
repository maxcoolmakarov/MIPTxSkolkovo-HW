One night the Hodja looked into his well and saw there the reflection 
of the full moon.  
 "Oh no!" he exclaimed. "The moon has fallen from the sky and into my 
well!"  
 He ran into his house and returned with a hook attached to a rope. He 
then threw the hook into the water and commenced to pull it up again, but 
it became stuck on the side of the well. Frantically the Hodja tugged and 
pulled with all his might. The hook suddenly came loose, and the Hodja 
fell over backwards, landing flat on his back. Scarcely able to move, he 
looked up into the sky and saw the full moon above him.  
 "I may have injured myself in doing so," he said with satisfaction, 
"but at least I got the moon back into the sky where it belongs."
