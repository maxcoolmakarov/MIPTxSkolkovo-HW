Once upon a time there was a young lady called Lady Mary, who had two 
brothers. One summer they all three went to a country seat of theirs, 
which they had not before visited. Among the other gentry in the 
neighborhood who came to see them was a Mr. Fox, a bachelor, with whom 
they, particularly the young lady, were much pleased. He used often to 
dine with them, and frequently invited Lady Mary to come and see his 
house. One day that her brothers were absent elsewhere, and she had 
nothing better to do, she determined to go thither, and accordingly set 
out unattended. When she arrived at the house and knocked at the door, no 
one answered. 
 At length she opened it and went in; over the portal of the door was 
written: "Be bold, be bold, but not too bold." She advanced; over the 
staircase was the same inscription. She went up; over the entrance of a 
gallery, the same again. Still she went on, and over the door of a chamber 
found written: 
 
 
 Be bold, be bold, but not too bold, 
Lest that your heart's blood should run cold! 
 
 

She opened it; it was full of skeletons and tubs of blood. She retreated 
in haste, and, coming downstairs, saw from a window Mr. Fox advancing 
towards the house with a drawn sword in one hand, while with the other he 
dragged along a young lady by her hair. Lady Mary had just time to slip 
down and hide herself under the stairs before Mr. Fox and his victim 
arrived at the foot of them. As he pulled the young lady upstairs, she 
caught hold of one of the banisters with her hand, on which was a rich 
bracelet. Mr. Fox cut it off with his sword. The hand and bracelet fell 
into Lady Mary's lap, who then contrived to escape unobserved, and got 
safe home to her brothers' house. 
 A few days afterwards Mr. Fox came to dine with them as usual. After 
dinner the guests began to amuse each other with extraordinary anecdotes, 
and Lady Mary said she would relate to them a remarkable dream she had 
lately had.  
 "I dreamt," said she, "that as you, Mr. Fox, had often invited me to 
your house, I would go there one morning. When I came to the house I 
knocked at the door, but no one answered. When I opened the door, over the 
hall I saw written, 'Be bold, be bold, but not too bold.' But," said she, 
turning to Mr. Fox, and smiling, "It is not so, nor it was not so."  
 Then she pursued the rest of the story, concluding at every turn with, 
"It is not so, nor it was not so," until she came to the room full of 
skeletons, when Mr. Fox took up the burden of the tale, and said: 
 
 
 It is not so, nor it was not so, 
And God forbid it should be so! 
 
 

which he continued to repeat at every subsequent turn of the dreadful 
story, until she came to the circumstance of his cutting off the young 
lady's hand, when, upon his saying, as usual: 
 
 
It is not so, nor it was not so, 
And God forbid it should be so! 
 
 

Lady Mary retorts by saying:
 
 
 But it is so, and it was so, 
And here the hand I have to show! 
 
 

at the same moment producing the hand and bracelet from her lap, whereupon 
the guests drew their swords, and instantly cut Mr. Fox into a thousand 
pieces.
