East of Immendorf in Swabia, and belonging to that place, is George's Meadow. In the vicinity are George's Spring, George's Acre, and George's Pasture. The church in Immenstadt is dedicated to Saint George, and Saint George's Day is celebrated with dancing, games, and other popular entertainments. In the church there is a wooden statue depicting Saint George killing the lindorm next to one of a kneeling maiden wearing a golden crown and with folded hands. 
In ancient times a lindorm had his lair on George's Meadow. Every year on a certain day a person, chosen by lot, had to be brought to him to eat.  Once the lot fell to a maiden who belonged to the long-time lineage of the Heideckers. However, on this day the lindorm was killed by the knight Saint George, thus rescuing the maiden with his brave deed. 
On the site where the church now stands was formerly a castle. One can still see there a somewhat elevated place surrounded by the depression of the former moat.
