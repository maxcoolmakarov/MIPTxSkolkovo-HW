Once upon a time there was a little woman who had a little room and a
little hen. The hen laid an egg and the little woman took it and made a
little omelet of it, and put it to cool in the window. Along came a fly
and ate it up. Imagine what an omelet that must have been! The little
woman went to the magistrate and told him her story. He gave her a club
and told her to kill the fly with it wherever she saw it. At that moment a
fly lighted on the magistrate's nose, and the woman, believing it to be
the same fly, gave it a blow and broke the magistrate's nose.
