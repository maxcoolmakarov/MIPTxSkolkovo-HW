In Sabitz near Bergen there formerly lived a number of peasants who, it 
was said, possessed a black book. With its help they were able to acquire 
substantial wealth, and if they did anything bad to a neighbor, they 
always went unpunished. Whoever wanted to use the black book had to read 
the text forwards and backwards. The devil gained control of anyone who 
failed to read it backwards. It was no longer known where the book came 
from. The oldest people knew only that they had come into its possession 
through an inheritance. Sometimes the book caused its owners much grief, 
so finally they tried to dispose of it. For a long time these attempts 
were to no avail, until they sought the advise of a pastor. He freed them 
from the book by nailing shut the drawer in which it was being stored.
