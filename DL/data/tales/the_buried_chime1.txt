Under the cliffs at Whitby, when the great tides landward flow,   
Under the cliffs at Whitby, when the great winds landward blow,   
When the long billows heavily roll o'er the harbour bar,  
And the blue waves flash to silver 'mid the seaweeds on the Scar,  
When the low thunder of the surf calls down the hollow shore,  
And 'mid the caves at Kettleness the baffled breakers roar;  
Under the cliffs at Whitby, whoso will stand alone,  
Where, in the shadow of the Nab, the eddies swirl and moan,  
When, to the pulses of the deep, the flood-tide rising swells,  
Will hear, amid its monotone, the clash of hidden bells.  
Up from the heart of ocean the mellow music peals,  
Where the sunlight makes his golden path, and the sea-mew flits and wheels.  
For many a chequered century, untired by flying time,  
The bells, no human fingers touch, have rung their hidden chime,  
Since the gallant ship that brought them, for the abbey on the height,  
Struck and foundered in the offing, with her sacred goal in sight.  
And the man who dares on Hallowe'en on the Black Nab to watch,  
Till the rose-light on St. Hilda's shrine the midnight moonbeams catch,  
And calls his sweetheart by her name, as, o'er the sleeping seas,  
The echo of the buried bells comes floating on the breeze,  
'Ere another moon on Hallowe'en her eerie rays has shed,  
Will hear his wedding peal ring out from the church-tower on the Head.
