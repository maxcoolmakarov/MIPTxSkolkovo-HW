There was once a wily old crocodile who dwelt in a tank [pond] hard by
a village, and he was sometimes so ferocious that he would seize children
who used to go for water there, then drown and eat them. He had become, in
fact, the terror of the place. 
 One year there was a very great drought, and the tank by degrees began
to dry up, and at last it got quite dry, and the crocodile was to be seen
grilling and roasting in the sun. 
 He used to call out to the passers-by, "Oh! pray take pity upon me and
show me where I can go for water, for I am dying in this heat." 
 "No, indeed! they all said. "We are glad to see you suffering, for have
you not often made us suffer by taking our goats, and sometimes even our
children? We shall not help you in any way." 
 At last an old man passed by, and the crocodile appealed to him, and at
first he replied as the others did, but afterwards he relented and said,
"Well, if you will follow me I will take you to a tank which is never
dry." So the crocodile followed him, and he showed him a tank no great
distance off, which was filled with water. 
 The old man went first into the tank himself, and calling to the
crocodile, he said, "See here, how deep it is!" 
 No sooner had the crocodile had a good drink, than he made a grab at
the old man's leg. "Ah-ho! Ah-ho!" said the old man. "What are you
doing?" 
 "Well," replied the crocodile, "I have had a good drink, thanks to you,
and as I have had no food for many days, I am going to make a meal of you.
That is what I am going to do." 
 "You wretched and ungrateful brute!" said the old man. "Is this the way
you reward me?" 
 At that moment a jackal hove in sight, coming for a drink (the jackals,
we know, are the most cunning of all animals), and the old man said, "I
will put my case before him, and if he says you are to eat me, very good,
so you shall." 
 The old man then beckoned to the jackal to come close up to the tank,
and told him all the facts of the case. 
 The jackal said, "You know I am always a just judge, and if you want me
to decide, you must show me the place from whence you brought the
crocodile." 
 So they all three wended their way back to the tank near the village,
and the jackal said, "Show me the exact spot where you first found the
crocodile," and when they got there the jackal said, "Now I am going to
give you my judgment, so prepare to listen." Then turning to the old man,
he said quietly, "You silly old idiot! What made you ever help a
crocodile? Now, you run one way, and I will run the other." 
 The jackal gave a skip, and was soon off out of sight, and the old man
took to his heels also, and soon got away. The wily old crocodile, now
balked of his prey, said to himself, "I know my way back to that water
tank, and I will someday have my revenge on that jackal, for he is sure to
come there to lap water." 
 So back he went, and as there were many trees near the tank, some of
whose roots went beneath the water, the crocodile lay in ambush there. By
and by the jackal came to drink water, and the crocodile made a sudden
snap at his leg, and held it. 
 "Oh, you foolish crocodile!" the jackal said, "you think you have got
hold of my leg, do you? But it is only the root of a tree."  
 Hearing this, the crocodile released his hold, and the jackal jumped
off in high glee out of his reach. 
 The crocodile then determined that he would try some other plan of
entrapping him. So, as there were great numbers of a small fruit falling
from one of the trees, which he knew the jackal came to eat, he one night
piled up a heap and hid himself beneath it, leaving only his eyes
uncovered. 
 Presently the jackal came prowling along, and noticing the pile of
fruit he felt inclined to partake of some, but he drew near very
cautiously, and in a moment he caught sight of the two eyes of the
crocodile glistening in the moonlight, when he called out, "Oh, I see
you!" and scampered off. 
 After this, the crocodile saw that it was no use to try himself to
catch the jackal, "for," said he, "he is too cunning for me. I must employ
someone who comes to get water here."  
 So one day he saw a farmer, and said to him, "If you will catch a
jackal for me, I will make you a rich man, for I will give you several
jewels which people have dropped in this tank for years and years, and
they are lying here at the bottom." 
 "Oh!" replied the farmer, "that is easily done." So that very night he
went into the jungle and lay down as if dead.  
 Presently the jackal made his appearance, and smelling along he came
close up to the body. Then he hesitated and said, "I wonder if this is
really a dead body or not." He then called out audibly, "If it is really
dead it will shake its leg, and if it is alive it won't do so." This he
said so quickly and so artfully that the farmer was taken aback, and to
make him believe he  was  dead he at once stupidly shook his leg, and
off skipped the jackal, saying, "I caught you there," and was lost to view
in an instant. 
 The farmer, who was very avaricious, and wanted the jewels badly, made
up his mind that he would by hook or by crook make sure of the jackal on
the next occasion. So this time he prepared of the softest wax a doll the
size of a child, and digging a small grave and covering it over with
leaves and mud, he waited in hiding to see the result. 
 Shortly after sunset the jackal began to prowl about as usual, and
coming on the new grave he said to himself, "Ah! This is someone lately
buried. I will try my luck here." He then began to scratch with his paw,
and presently one paw got caught in the wax, and in trying to get that
away, all four became stuck with the wax, when in a moment out came the
farmer from his hiding place and said, "Ah! At last I have got you, and
you are my prisoner!" 
 The jackal yelled and howled, and endeavored to escape, but was
hindered by the wax on his feet. So then he took to frightening the
farmer, and said, "If you do not get me out of this scrape I will call all
the jackals in a moment of time, and they will destroy you forever, for do
you not know that I am the king of the jackals?" 
 "What am I to do?" asked the farmer. 
 "Go!" he said. "Go and get some oil, and rub it all over me. Then get a
fowl, and tie it about fifty yards away, and bring two men with hatchets
to stand over me, so that if I attempt to get away they may chop me to
pieces!" 
 This being done by the farmer, the jackal while being held in his hands
sought his opportunity, and being well greased all over, he made a violent
spring and so got clear of the farmer. Then he dashed between the legs of
the men with hatchets, when they made a plunge at him, but they only
succeeded in hurting their own legs. So the jackal got finally off, and
picking up the fowl, he was soon lost to view, and so won the day.
