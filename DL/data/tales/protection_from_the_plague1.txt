It is certainly and constantly affirmed, that on Midsummer Eve, that is, the day before the nativity of St. John Baptist there is found under the root of mugwort, a coal, which preserves or keeps them safe from the plague, carbuncle, lightning, the quartan ague, and from burning that bear the same about them: And Mizaldus, the writer hereof, saith, that he doth hear that it is to be found the same day under the root of plantane; which I know to be of truth, for I have found them the same day under the root of plantane. It is to be found at noon.
