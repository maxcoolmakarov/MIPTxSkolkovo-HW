The Leine demands ten sacrifices every year ( de Leine fret alle 
jâr teine ), and if these do not drown then they die in some 
other manner. Thus one hot summer a servant girl was bringing their meal 
to some household servants who were working in a field near Hollenstedt. 
She was very thirsty and asked if they had something to drink in their 
jug. They had drunk everything and told her to go the Leine, which was 
here very shallow, and get a drink from the river. The girl went to the 
bank and drank, but she never stood up again, for she was dead.  
 A boy insisted on approaching the water, but he was not allowed to do 
so. They held him back from the water, but he died soon thereafter anyway. 
 
 There are three bridges on the Pfingst Meadow near Hollenstedt. Once a 
cavalryman en route to Stöckheim was riding across the meadow. Near 
the middle bridge he heard a voice cry out loudly, "If he is not here yet, 
then he is not coming," and in the same instant a boy came running toward 
him. Thinking that the child might drown (if he were pulled into the 
water) he quickly dropped his leather glove and asked the boy to pick it 
up and hand it to him. As the boy was reaching the glove toward him, he 
grabbed him by the hand and pulled him up onto the horse. However, the boy 
died immediately while seated before him on the horse.
