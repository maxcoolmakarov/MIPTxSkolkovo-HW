Legend Book of the Prussian State  
On the Island of Amrum there were many underground people, little 
manikins or dwarfs no taller than a table.  They wore red caps on their 
heads.  It was feared that if one did not keep watch over a newborn child 
until it was baptized, it might be exchanged by the underground people.
