Listen, lords, in bower and hall,  
I sing the wonderous birth  
Of brave St. George, whose valorous arm  
Rid monsters from the earth:   
 Distressed ladies to relieve  
He travell'd many a day;  
In honour of the Christian faith,  
Which shall endure for aye.   
 In Coventry sometime did dwell  
A knight of worthy fame,  
High steward of this noble realme;  
Lord Albert was his name.   
 He had to wife a princely dame,  
Whose beauty did excell.  
This virtuous lady, being with child,  
In sudden sadness fell:   
 For thirty nights no sooner sleep  
Had clos'd her wakeful eyes,  
But, lo! a foul and fearful dream  
Her fancy would surprize:   
 She dreamt a dragon fierce and fell  
Conceiv'd within her womb;  
Whose mortal fangs her body rent  
Ere he to life could come.   
 All woe-begone, and sad was she;  
She nourisht constant woe:  
Yet strove to hide it from her lord,  
Lest he should sorrow know.   
 In vain she strove, her tender lord,  
Who watch'd her slightest look,  
Discover'd soon her secret pain,  
And soon that pain partook.   
 And when to him the fearful cause  
She weeping did impart,  
With kindest speech he strove to heal  
The anguish of her heart.   
 Be comforted, my lady dear,  
Those pearly drops refrain;  
Betide me weal, betide me woe,  
I'll try to ease thy pain.   
 And for this foul and fearful dream,  
That causeth all thy woe,  
Trust me I'll travel far away  
But I'll the meaning knowe.   
 Then giving many a fond embrace,  
And shedding many a teare,  
To the weïrd lady of the woods  
He purpos'd to repaire.   
 To the weïrd lady of the woods,  
Full long and many a day,  
Thro' lonely shades, and thickets rough  
He winds his weary way.   
 At length he reach'd a dreary dell  
With dismal yews o'erhung;  
Where cypress spred it's mournful boughs,  
And pois'nous nightshade sprung.   
 No chearful gleams here pierc'd the gloom,  
He hears no chearful sound;  
But shrill night-ravens' yelling scream,  
And serpents hissing round.   
 The shriek of fiends, and damned ghosts  
Ran howling thro' his ear:  
A chilling horror froze his heart,  
Tho' all unus'd to fear.   
 Three times he strives to win his way,  
And pierce those sickly dews:  
Three times to bear his trembling corse  
His knocking knees refuse.   
 At length upon his beating breast  
He signs the holy crosse;  
And, rouzing up his wonted might,  
He treads th' unhallow'd mosse.   
 Beneath a pendant craggry cliff,  
All vaulted like a grave,  
And opening in the solid rock,  
He found the inchanted cave.   
 An iron gate clos'd up the mouth,  
All hideous and forlorne;  
And, fasten'd by a silver chain,  
Near hung a brazed horne.   
 Then offering up a secret prayer,  
Three times he blowes amaine:  
Three times a deepe and hollow sound  
Did answer him againe.   
 "Sir knight, thy lady beares a son,  
Who, like a dragon bright,  
Shall prove most dreadful to his foes,  
And terrible in fight.   
 His name advanc'd in future times  
On banners shall be worn:  
But lo! thy lady's life must passe  
 Before he can be born."   
 All sore opprest with fear and doubt  
Long time lord Albert stood;  
At length he winds his doubtful way  
Back thro' the dreary wood.   
 Eager to clasp his lovely dame  
Then fast he travels back:  
But when he reach'd his castle gate,  
His gate was hung with black.   
 In every court and hall he found  
A sullen silence reigne;  
Save where, amid the lonely towers,  
He heard her maidens' plaine;   
 And bitterly lament and weep,  
With many a grievous grone:  
Then sore his bleeding heart misgave,  
His lady's life was gone.   
 With faultering step he enters in,  
Yet half affraid to goe;  
With trembling voice asks why they grieve,  
Yet fears the cause to knowe.   
 "Three times the sun hath rose and set;"  
They said, then stopt to weep:  
"Since heaven hath laid thy lady deare  
In death's eternal sleep.   
 For, ah! in travel sore she fell,  
So sore that she must dye;  
Unless some shrewd and cunning leech  
Could ease her presentlye.   
 But when a cunning leech was fet,  
Too soon declared he,  
She, or her babe must lose its life;  
Both saved could not be.   
 Now take my life, thy lady said,  
My little infant save:  
And 0 commend me to my lord,  
When I am laid in grave.   
 0 tell him how that precious babe  
Cost him a tender wife  
And teach my son to lisp her name,  
Who died to save his life.   
 Then calling still upon thy name,  
And praying still for thee;  
Without repining or complaint,  
Her gentle soul did flee."   
 What tongue can paint lord Albret's woe,  
The bitter tears he shed,  
The bitter pangs that wrung his heart,  
To find his lady dead?   
 He beat his breast: he tore his hair;  
And shedding many a tear,  
At length he askt to see his son;  
The son that cost so dear.   
 New sorrowe seiz'd the damsells all:  
At length they faultering say;  
"Alas! my lord, how shall we tell?  
Thy son is stoln away.   
 Fair as the sweetest flower of spring,  
Such was his infant mien:  
And on his little body stampt  
Three wonderous marks were seen:   
 A blood-red cross was on his arm;  
A dragon on his breast:  
A little garter all of gold  
Was round his leg exprest.   
 Three carefull nurses we provide  
Our little lord to keep:  
One gave him sucke, one gave him food,  
And one did lull to sleep.   
 But lo! all in the dead of night,  
We heard a fearful sound:  
Loud thunder clapt; the castle shook;  
And lightning flasht around.   
 Dead with affright at first we lay;   
But rousing up anon,  
We ran to see our little lord:  
Our little lord was gone!   
 But how or where we could not tell;  
For lying on the ground,  
In deep and magic slumbers laid,  
The nurses there we found."   
 "0 grief on grief!" lord Albret said:  
No more his tongue cou'd say,  
When falling in a deadly swoone,  
Long time he lifeless lay.   
 At length restor'd to life and sense  
He nourisht endless woe,  
No future joy his heart could taste,  
No future comfort know.   
 So withers on the mountain top  
A fair and stately oake,  
Whose vigorous arms are torne away,  
By some rude thunder-stroke.   
 At length his castle irksome grew,  
He loathes his wonted home;  
His native country he forsakes  
In foreign lands to roame.   
 There up and downe he wandered far,  
Clad in a palmer's gown;  
Till his brown locks grew white as wool,  
His beard as thistle down.   
 At length, all wearied, down in death  
He laid his reverend head.  
Meantime amid the lonely wilds  
His litttle son was bred.   
 There the weïrd lady of the woods  
Had borne him far away,  
And train'd him up in feates of armes,  
And every martial play.
