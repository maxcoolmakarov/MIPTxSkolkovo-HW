Legends and Tales from the Upper Harz  
A mother had her child exchanged by the dwarfs, and in its place they 
laid a changeling.  The mother was concerned, because the child looked so 
very old.  She shared her grief with a laborer.  He told her that it 
wasn't her child, but rather a dwarf.  She could prove this by boiling 
some oil while holding the child and then asking him how old he was.  The 
woman did this.  With the child on her arm, she put the oil on the fire.  
It asked her what she was doing, and the mother said that she wanted to 
brew some beer.  With that she set some empty walnut shells around the 
fire, so she could later pour the beer into them.  Then the dwarf said, 
innocently and without thinking:
  
 
Now I am as old  
As the Harz Wood,  
And I've never seen anything like this,  
My entire life long.  
Brewing beer in walnut shells!
 
 
Now the mother knew that it was an old dwarf.  Thus she set him down and 
threatened to kill him if he didn't bring her child back.  The dwarf told 
just to go outside for a short while.  When she came back in, her child 
was there and the dwarf was gone.  Later the child became large, strong, 
wealthy, and very happy.
