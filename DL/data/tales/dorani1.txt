Once upon a time there lived in a city of Hindustan a seller of scents and 
essences, who had a very beautiful daughter named Dorani. This maiden had 
a friend who was a fairy, and the two were high in favor with Indra, the 
king of fairyland, because they were able to sing so sweetly and dance so 
deftly that no one in the kingdom could equal them for grace and beauty. 
Dorani had the most lovely hair in the world, for it was like spun gold, 
and the smell of it was like the smell of fresh roses. But her locks were 
so long and thick that the weight of it was often unbearable, and one day 
she cut off a shining tress, and wrapping it in a large leaf, threw it in 
the river which ran just below her window.   
Now it happened that the king's son was out hunting, and had gone down to 
the river to drink, when there floated towards him a folded leaf, from 
which came a perfume of roses. The prince, with idle curiosity, took a 
step into the water and caught the leaf as it was sailing by. He opened 
it, and within he found a lock of hair like spun gold, and from which came 
a faint, exquisite odor.   
When the prince reached home that day he looked so sad and was so quiet 
that his father wondered if any ill had befallen him, and asked what was 
the matter. Then the youth took from his breast the tress of hair which he 
had found in the river, and holding it up to the light, replied, "See, my 
father, was ever hair like this? Unless I may win and marry the maiden 
that owns that lock I must die!"   
So the king immediately sent heralds throughout all his dominions to 
search for the damsel with hair like spun gold; and at last he learned 
that she was the daughter of the scent-seller.   
The object of the herald's mission was quickly noised abroad, and Dorani 
heard of it with the rest; and, one day, she said to her father, "If the 
hair is mine, and the king requires me to marry his son, I must do so; 
but, remember, you must tell him that if, after the wedding, I stay all 
day at the palace, every night will be spent in my old home."   
The old man listened to her with amazement, but answered nothing, as he 
knew she was wiser than he. Of course the hair was Dorani's, and heralds 
soon returned and informed the king, their master, who summoned the 
scent-seller, and told him that he wished for his daughter to be given in 
marriage to the prince.   
The father bowed his head three times to the ground, and replied, "Your 
highness is our lord, and all that you bid us we will do. The maiden asks 
this only -- that if, after the wedding, she stays all day at the palace, 
she may go back each night to her father's house."   
The king thought this a very strange request; but said to himself it was, 
after all, his son's affair, and the girl would surely soon get tired of 
going to and fro. So he made no difficulty, and everything was speedily 
arranged and the wedding was celebrated with great rejoicings.   
At first, the condition attaching to his wedding with the lovely Dorani 
troubled the prince very little, for he thought that he would at least see 
his bride all day. But, to his dismay, he found that she would do nothing 
but sit the whole time upon a stool with her head bowed forward upon her 
knees, and he could never persuade her to say a single word.   
Each evening she was carried in a palanquin to her father's house, and 
each morning she vas brought back soon after daybreak; and yet never a 
sound passed her lips, nor did she show by any sign that she saw, or 
heard, or heeded her husband. One evening the prince, very unhappy and 
troubled, was wandering in an old and beautiful garden near the palace. 
  
The gardener was a very aged man, who had served the prince's great 
grandfather; and when he saw the prince he came and bowed himself to him, 
and said, "Child! child! why do you look so sad? Is aught the matter?"   
Then the prince replied, "I am sad, old friend, because I have married a 
wife as lovely as the stars, but she will not speak to me, and I know not 
what to do. Night after night she leaves me for her father's house, and 
day after day she sits in mine as though turned to stone, and utters no 
word, whatever I may do or say."   
The old man stood thinking for a moment, and then he hobbled off to his 
own cottage. A little later he came back to the prince with five or six 
small packets, which he placed in his hands and said, "Tomorrow, when your 
bride leaves the palace, sprinkle the powder from one of these packets 
upon your body, and while seeing clearly, you will become yourself 
invisible. More I cannot do for you, but may all go well!"   
And the prince thanked him, and put the packets carefully away in his 
turban.   
The next night, when Dorani left for her father's house in her palanquin, 
the prince took out a packet of the magic powder and sprinkled it over 
himself, and then hurried after her. He soon found that, as the old man 
had promised, he was invisible to everyone, although he felt as usual, and 
could see all that passed. He speedily overtook the palanquin and walked 
beside it to the scent-seller's dwelling. There it was set down, and, when 
his bride, closely veiled, left it and entered the house, he, too, entered 
unperceived.   
At the first door Dorani removed one veil; then she entered another 
doorway at the end of a passage where she removed another veil; next she 
mounted the stairs, and at the door of the women's quarters removed a 
third veil. After this she proceeded to her own room where were set two 
large basins, one of attar of roses and one of water; in these she washed 
herself, and afterwards called for food. A servant brought her a bowl of 
curds, which she ate hastily, and then arrayed herself in a robe of 
silver, and wound about her strings of pearls, while a wreath of roses 
crowned her hair.   
When fully dressed, she seated herself upon a four-legged stool over which 
was a canopy with silken curtains, these she drew around her, and then 
called out, "Fly, stool, to the palace of rajah Indra."   
Instantly the stool rose in the air, and the invisible prince, who had 
watched all these proceedings with great wonder, seized it by one leg as 
it flew away, and found himself being borne through the air at a rapid 
rate. In a short while they arrived at the house of the fairy who, as I 
told you before, was the favorite friend of Dorani.   
The fairy stood waiting on the threshold, as beautifully dressed as Dorani 
herself was, and when the stool stopped at her door she cried in 
astonishment, "Why, the stool is flying all crooked today! What is the 
reason of that, I wonder? I suspect that you have been talking to your 
husband, and so it will not fly straight."   
But Dorani declared that she had not spoken one word to him, and she 
couldn't think why the stool flew as if weighed down at one side. The 
fairy still looked doubtful, but made no answer, and took her seat beside 
Dorani, the prince again holding tightly one leg. Then the stool flew on 
through the air until it came to the palace of Indra the rajah.   
All through the night the women sang and danced before the rajah Indra, 
whilst a magic lute played of itself the most bewitching music; till the 
prince, who sat watching it all, was quite entranced.   
Just before dawn the rajah gave the signal to cease; and again the two 
women seated themselves on the stool, and, with the prince clinging to the 
leg, it flew back to earth, and bore Dorani and her husband safely to the 
scent-seller's shop. Here the prince hurried away by himself past Dorani's 
palanquin with its sleepy bearers, straight on to the palace; and, as he 
passed the threshold of his own rooms he became visible again. Then he lay 
down upon a couch and waited for Dorani's arrival.   
As soon as she arrived she took a seat and As soon as she arrived she took 
a seat and remained as silent as usual, with her head bowed on her knees. 
  
For a while not a sound was heard, but presently the prince said, "I 
dreamed a curious dream last night, and as it was all about you I am going 
to tell it you, although you heed nothing."   
The girl, indeed, took no notice of his words, but in spite of that he 
proceeded to relate every single thing that had happened the evening 
before, leaving out no detail of all that he had seen or heard. And when 
he praised her singing -- and his voice shook a little -- Dorani just 
looked at him; but she said naught, though, in her own mind, she was 
filled with wonder.   
"What a dream!" she thought. "Could it have been a dream? How could he 
have learnt in a dream all she had done or said?" Still she kept silent; 
only she looked that once at the prince, and then remained all day as 
before, with her head bowed upon her knees.   
When night came the prince again made himself invisible and followed her. 
The same things happened again as had happened before, but Dorani sang 
better than ever. In the morning the prince a second time told Dorani all 
that she had done, pretending that he had dreamt of it.   
Directly he had finished Dorani gazed at him, and said, "Is it true that 
you dreamt this, or were you really there?"   
"I was there," answered the prince.   
"But why do you follow me?" asked the girl.   
"Because," replied the prince, "I love you, and to be with you is 
happiness."   
This time Dorani's eyelids quivered; but she said no more, and was silent 
the rest of the day. However, in the evening, just as she was stepping 
into her palanquin, she said to the prince, "If you love me, prove it by 
not following me tonight."   
And so the prince did as she wished, and stayed at home.   
That evening the magic stool flew so unsteadily that they could hardly 
keep their seats, and at last the fairy exclaimed, "There is only one 
reason that it should jerk like this! You have been talking to your 
husband!"   
And Dorani replied, "Yes, I have spoken; oh, yes, I have spoken!" But no 
more would she say.   
That night Dorani sang so marvelously that at the end the rajah Indra rose 
up and vowed that she might ask what she would and he would give it to 
her.   
At first she was silent; but, when he pressed her, she answered, "Give me 
the magic lute."   
The rajah, when he heard this, was displeased with himself for having made 
so rash a promise, because this lute he valued above all his possessions. 
But as he had promised, so he must perform, and with an ill grace he 
handed it to her.   
"You must never come here again," said he, "for, once having asked so 
much, how will you in future be content with smaller gifts?"   
Dorani bowed her head silently as she took the lute, and passed with the 
fairy out of the great gate, where the stool awaited them. More unsteadily 
than before, it flew back to earth.   
When Dorani got to the palace that morning she asked the prince whether he 
had dreamt again.   
He laughed with happiness, for this time she had spoken to him of her own 
free will; and he replied, "No; but I begin to dream now -- not of what 
 has  happened in the past, but of what  may  happen in the 
future."   
That day Dorani sat very quietly, but she answered the prince when he 
spoke to her; and when evening fell, and with it the time for her 
departure, she still sat on.   
Then the prince came close to her and said softly, "Are you not going to 
your house, Dorani?"   
At that she rose and threw herself weeping into his arms, whispering 
gently, "Never again, my lord, never again would I leave thee!"   
So the prince won his beautiful bride; and though they neither of them 
dealt any further with fairies and their magic, they learnt more daily of 
the magic of Love, which one may still learn, although fairy magic has 
fled away.
