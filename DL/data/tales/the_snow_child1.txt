A merchant lived with his wife in their cottage by the shore.  Their's was not an easy life, for his voyages kept him away from home many months at a time.  One homecoming following a particularly long and arduous voyage, the merchant was greeted by his wife and an infant child.  He was surprised, but not especially pleased, to see the newborn baby, as he had been at sea for nearly a year.  
The wife countered the husband's inquiring look with an explanation.  
"No, it is not your son," she admitted.  "It's a miracle boy, a Snow Child!"  She continued, "One winter's day while returning home from church I slipped on the ice and fell into a snow bank.  Nine months later I gave birth to our Snow Child.  Is he not a wonder!"  
The husband had to admit that the child was a wonder, for he had no color.  His hair and his skin were a bleached white.  The merchant seemed to accept the new family member.  
Many voyages and seasons later, it was on a hot summer's day, the merchant, announced to his wife that he would be going to market in the next village.  "I'll take the Snow Child along for an outing," he said.  
The merchant arrived back home that evening, but he was alone.  
"Where is our son?" asked the anxious mother.  
"Something terrible happened," responded the husband.  "We were walking across a broad meadow in the hot sun, and he ...," the husband faltered.  "And he melted."
