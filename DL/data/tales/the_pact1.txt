A long time ago a peasant at Kolman entered into a ten-year pact with the devil.  The Evil One was to serve the peasant for ten years, after which the latter would be delivered to hell.  The time passed quickly, and the tenth year was nearly at an end.  On the last evening the miserable peasant took refuge with a priest.  The priest had him climb into a tub filled with holy water and then blessed him with all kinds of prayers.  
Thus they awaited the hour of midnight.  Soon the devil stormed in to take away his victim.  He raged and howled for an hour. Finally the clock struck twelve, and the devil had to retreat, but not before he had pulled out a tuft of the peasant's hair.
