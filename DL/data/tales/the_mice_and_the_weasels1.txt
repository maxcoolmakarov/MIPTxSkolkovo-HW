There was war between the mice and the weasels, in which the mice always 
got the worst of it, numbers of them being 

killed and eaten by the weasels. So they called a council of war, in which 
an old mouse got up and said, "It's no 

wonder we are always beaten, for we have no generals to plan our battles 
and direct our movements in the field." 

Acting on his advice, they chose the biggest mice to be their leaders, and 
these, in order to be distinguished from 

the rank and file, provided themselves with helmets bearing large plumes 
of straw. They then led out the mice to 

battle, confident of victory; but they were defeated as usual, and were 
soon scampering as fast as they could to their 

holes. All made their way to safety without difficulty except the leaders, 
who were so hampered by the badges of their 

rank that they could not get into their holes, and fell easy victims to 
their pursuers.  
 Moral: Greatness carries its own penalties.
