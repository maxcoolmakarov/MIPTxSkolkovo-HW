In Venice there was a merchant whose journeys kept him away from home for one or three years at a time. Once upon returning he found a good-looking boy running around in his house.    
The man asked, "Whose good-looking boy is this?"  
His wife said, "Husband, he is mine. Let me tell you how I came to have this child. In the winter I was walking in the garden, thinking about you with longing. Just then a ice cycle fell from the roof. I ate it, and the child grew out of it. As a sign of this, his name is Glacies."  
The good man said nothing, not wanting to make to much of the situation, for if a man scolds his wife, he is only scolding himself. Furthermore, he thought, if you had been with her, this probably would not have happened. Just as you have broken foreign jugs while abroad, she has broken some pots here at home.   
Glacies grew up and became large.  
One day the man said to his wife, "What do you think if I took our Glacies with me, so he could learn the art of buying and selling, so in the future he will know whether or not he wants to become a merchant."   
His wife said, "But you must take care of him."   
The man took him along, and sold him overseas.   
A long time later he returned home, but did not bring the child with him.  
The woman said, "What have you done with our child Glacies?"  
The man said, "A strange thing happened to him. One day while we were sailing on the sea it was terribly hot. I told him not to sit there bare-headed, but he did so anyway. The sun was so hot on hi head that he melted and ran into the sea. Just as he came from water, he became water once again.
