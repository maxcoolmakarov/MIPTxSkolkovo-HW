North German Legends, Tales, and
Customs 

The Nickert is a small gray person that lives in the water and has a great
desire for human children.  If they have not yet been baptized, he will
steal
them, leaving his own children in their place.  They are very small, but
have
large, broad heads. 
Once a woman on a journey gave birth to a child at Scharfenbrück.  As
soon
as she had recovered and was crossing the Ruthe Bridge on her way home,
the
Nickert came upon her without being seen and stole her newborn child,
leaving in
its place his malformed brat with its thick head.  It lived for eight
years, and
then died.  If the woman had not crossed over running water with her
newborn,
the Nickert would not have been able to do anything to her. 
The changelings that the Nickert substitutes for human children are very
strong,
often having more strength than three strong men together. 
Once in Zühlichendorf there was a large Nickert child that was
completely
wild.  He dirtied himself, and was almost like an animal.  One day a
worker came
home with a heavily loaded wagon full of grain and ran into the gatepost
so hard
that he could not get loose.  The Nickert child, who was sitting inside
next to
the window, saw what had happened and asked, "Should I help you?" 
The bad-tempered worker replied, "You stupid quack, it's too heavy for
you!" 
Then the Nickert child came outside and with one powerful shove pushed the
wagon
free.  Three days later the Nickert child disappeared.
