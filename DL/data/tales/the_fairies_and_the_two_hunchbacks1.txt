A Story of Picardy  
 

Once there were three fairies who used to amuse themselves by dancing 
round and round, and singing, "Sunday, Monday; Sunday, Monday."   
One day a little hunchback surprised them at this sport, and without being 
afraid, he took them by the hand and began to dance with them, repeating 
also, "Sunday, Monday; Sunday, Monday."   
He danced so prettily that the fairies were charmed, and to reward him 
took away his hunch. Perfectly happy, he returned home, constantly singing 
as he went, "Sunday, Monday; Sunday, Monday."   
On the road he met another little hunchback whom he knew. The latter was 
greatly astonished to see his friend relieved of his hunch, and said, "How 
did you manage it? Your hunch is gone."   
"It is all very easy," replied the other. "You have only to go to a 
certain wood, when you will find some fairies. You must dance with them 
and sing, 'Sunday, Monday; Sunday, Monday,' and they will take away your 
hunch."   
"I will go, I will go at once," cried the little hunchback, and started 
immediately for the wood to which he had been directed, where, sure 
enough, he found the three fairies. Without hesitating, he took them by 
the hand and danced with them, repeating, "Sunday, Monday." But unhappily 
for him, he added, "Tuesday, Wednesday."   
The fairies, indignant, added to his hunch that of the first hunchback, so 
that he was a fright to behold, so frightful that if you had seen him you 
would have run away from him.   
And then ?  --  And then the cock crew, and it was day.
