One day Eve called to her Cain and Abel, who, still little children, were playing on the grass. 
  
She held out to her firstborn her right arm, and to her second son her left, and said, "Bite them, I command you." 
  
The elder boy bit till he drew blood, but Abel merely imprinted a long lingering kiss on his mother's arm. 
  
Then said Eve to her husband, "Our Cain will be a wicked man."
  
Adam and Eve loved Abel dearly. Cain was jealous of their partiality. He wished to kill his brother, but knew not how. Satan took the form of a raven, picked a quarrel with another raven, and in Cain's presence cut his opponent's throat with a pointed black pebble. Cain picked up the stone, hid it in his girdle, proposed to his brother a walk on the mountain, and there cut his throat with the pebble. The peasants of Armenia to this day call flints "Satan's nails," and conscientiously break every pointed black one they may find.
  
Cain, after his crime, dared not return to his parents; the blood of his brother still adhered to his hands. In vain did he hold them all day long immersed in a neighboring spring; the stain was still there. Night came on, and, not being able to sleep, he wandered long and far, seeking a waterfall. Guided at last to one by the noise of its waters in the still night, he lay down on the bank and held his reddened hands under the cascade. There he held them, day and night, summer and winter, during a whole year, without sleep and without food, but at the end of that time they were still as crimson as on the day of the crime. 
  
And so long as Cain lived, he was never able to get rid of the proof of his fratricide.
