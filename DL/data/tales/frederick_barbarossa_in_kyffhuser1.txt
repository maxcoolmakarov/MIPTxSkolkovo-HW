Mountain 
 
Many legends are in circulation dealing with this emperor.  They say that
he is not dead, but that he shall live until the Day of Judgment, and also
that no legitimate emperor shall rise up after him.  Until that time he
will remain hidden in Kyffh√§user Mountain.  When he appears he will
hang his shield on a dead tree, and leaves will sprout from the tree, and
then better times will be at hand.  From time to time he speaks to those
who find their way into the mountain, and from time to time he makes
appearances outside the mountain.  Generally he just sits there on a bench
at a round stone table, asleep with his head in his hands.  He constantly
nods his head and blinks his eyes.  His beard has grown very long,
according to some it has grown through the stone table, according to
others it has grown around the table.  They say that it must grow around
the circumference three times before he awakens.  At the present time it
has grown around the table twice. 
In the year 1669 a peasant from the village of Reblingen who was hauling
grain to Nordhausen was taken into the mountain by a little dwarf.  He was
told to empty out his grain and allowed to fill his sacks with gold in its
place.  He saw the emperor sitting there entirely motionless. 
In addition, a dwarf led a shepherd into the mountain who had once played
a tune on his flute that had pleased the emperor.  The emperor stood up
and asked:  "Are ravens still flying around the mountain?"  When the
shepherd answered "yes," the Kaiser responded:  "Then I must sleep for
another hundred years."
