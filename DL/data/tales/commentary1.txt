The fear that one's land might be stolen by a neighbor moving boundary
stones or plowing into an adjoining field must have been fairly common in
pre-industrial Europe, for there are many accounts, similar to the ones
above, that assign dire supernatural punishment to those who attempt such
dishonesty.
 An important literary treatment of this deception (but without the
supernatural consequences) is contained in the novella  Romeo und Julia
auf dem Dorfe  (A Village Romeo and Juliet) by the Swiss writer
Gottfried Keller.  Click here for a link to this text (in German):
