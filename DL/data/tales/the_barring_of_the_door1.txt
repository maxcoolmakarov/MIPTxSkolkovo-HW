It fell about the Martinmas time,  
And a gay time it was then;  
When our gudewife gat puddings to make,  
And she's boiled them in the pan.  

The wind sae cauld blew south and north, 
And blew intil the floor;  
Quoth our gudeman to our gudewife,  
"Get up and bar the door." 

"My hand is in my hussyskep,  
Gudeman, as ye may see,  
An it shouldna be barr'd this hundred year,   
It's no be barr'd for me!"  

They made a paction 'tween them twa,  
They made it firm and sure;  
That wha should speak the foremost word  
Should rise and bar the door.  

Then by there came twa gentlemen   
At twelve o'clock at night,  
And they could neither see house nor hall,  
Nor coal nor candle-light.  

"Now, whether is this a rich man's house,  
Or whether is it a poor?"  
But never a word would ane o' them speak,  
For barring of the door.  

And first they ate the white puddings, 
And then they ate the black;  
Though muckle thought the gudewife to hersel, 
Yet ne'er a word she spak.  

Then said the one unto the other, 
"Here, man, tak ye my knife,   
Do ye tak aff the auld man's beard,  
And I'll kiss the gudewife!"  

"But there's nae water in the house,  
And what shall we do then?"  
"What ails ye at the puddin' broo,  
That boils into the pan?"  

0 up then started our gudeman,  
And an angry man was he;  
"Will ye kiss my wife before my e'en,  
And scaud me wi' puddin' bree?"  

Then up and started our gudewife,  
Gied three skips on the floor;  
"Gudeman! ye've spoke the foremost word --  
Get up and bar the door!"
