The most stately monument of this sort [circles of detached stones] in
Scotland, and probably inferior to none in England, excepting Stonehenge,
is formed by what are called the Standing Stones of Stenhouse, in the
island of Pomona in the Orkneys, where it can scarcely be supposed that
Druids ever penetrated. At least, it is certain, that the common people
now consider it as a Scandinavian monument; and, according to an ancient
custom, a couple who are desirous to attach themselves by more than an
ordinary vow of fidelity, join hands through the round hole which is in
one of the stones. This they call the promise of Odin.
