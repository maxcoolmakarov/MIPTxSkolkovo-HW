Two burghers and a simple peasant, on their way to Mecca, found themselves with no food except enough flour to make a single small loaf of bread. The two burghers took counsel together how they might cheat their companion of his share, and proposed that whichever of the three should have the most wonderful dream while the bread was baking should have the loaf all to himself. Thinking thus to deceive the peasant, they placed the dough in the ashes and lay down to sleep. But the peasant saw through their trick, arose and ate the loaf when it was half baked, and lay down again. Then one of the burghers, as though frightened by his dream, awoke and called the other.    
"What's the matter?"   
"I've had a wonderful dream. Two angels opened the gates of heaven and brought me before the Lord."   
"That is a splendid dream," replied the other; "but I dreamed that two angels came, clove the earth asunder, and took me into hell."    
The peasant heard all this, but nevertheless pretended to be asleep. The burghers, however, who were taken in by their own trick ( decepti et decipere volentes ), called him to wake up.    
"Who is calling me?" he cried in great terror. "Have you come back?"    
"Where should we come back from?"   
"Why, I just had a dream in which I saw two angels take one of you and open the gates of heaven and lead him before the Lord; then two angels took the other of you, opened the earth, and led him into hell. And when I saw this, I realized that neither of you would return, so I got up and ate the bread."
