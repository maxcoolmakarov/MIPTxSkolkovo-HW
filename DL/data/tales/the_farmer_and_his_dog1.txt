A farmer who had just stepped into his field to mend a gap in one of his fences found at his return the cradle where he had left his only child asleep turned upside down, the clothes all torn and bloody, and his dog lying near it besmeared also with blood. Immediately conceiving that the creature had destroyed his child, he instantly dashed out his brains with the hatchet in his hand.   
When turning turning up the cradle, he found his child unhurt and an enourmous serpent lying dead on the floor, killed by that faithful dog, whose courage and fidelity in preserving the life of his son, deserved another kind of reward.   
These affecting circumstances afforded him a striking lesson, how dangerous it is too hastily to give way to the blind impulse of a sudden passion.

 
 
 Moral: 
 
 The greater room there appears for resentment, the more careful should we be not to accuse an innocent person.
