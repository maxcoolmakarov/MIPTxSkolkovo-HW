Near Wirchow in Neumark there is a circle of eighteen large stones.
Fourteen of them are between two and two and a half feet high, and they stand in
pairs, forming a large circle around two other stones, which stand in the middle
of the circle.  These two are more than two yards high.  Two additional stones,
still somewhat taller, stand outside the circle some distance removed. 
About the origin of these stones it is related that at this place several
hundred years ago a number of people gathered on Holy Whitsunday to carry
out a naked dance.  
As special punishment for their wicked behavior they were turned into
stones. Thus the stones are called "the Adam's Dance," or "the Stone Dance."  The
fourteen stones in the circle were the male and female dancers.  The two
in the middle were the beer servers, and the two outside the circle were the
musicians. One can still see violins on these latter ones.
