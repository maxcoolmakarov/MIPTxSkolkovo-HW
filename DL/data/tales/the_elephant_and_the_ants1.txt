In the days of old there was a great deal more jungle than there is now, 
and wild elephants were very numerous; once upon a time a red ant and a 
black ant were burrowing in the ground, when a wild elephant appeared and 
said, "Why are you burrowing here; I will trample all your work to 
pieces."   
The ants answered, "Why do you talk like this; do not despise us because 
we are small; perhaps we are better than you in some ways."   
The elephant said, "Do not talk nonsense. There is nothing at which you 
could beat me. I am in all ways the largest and most powerful animal on 
the face of the earth."   
Then the ants said, "Well, let us run a race and see who will win, unless 
you win we will not admit that you are supreme."   
At this the elephant got into a rage and shouted, "Well, come we will 
start at once," and it set off to run with all its might and when it got 
tired it looked down at the ground and there were two ants. So it started 
off again and when it stopped and looked down, there on the ground were 
two ants. So it ran on again, but wherever it stopped it saw the ants, and 
at last it ran so far that it dropped down dead from exhaustion.   
Now it is a saying that ants are more numerous in this world than any 
other kind of living creature; and what happened was that the two ants 
never ran at all, but stayed where they were; but whenever the elephant 
looked at the ground, it saw some ants running about and thought that they 
were the first two, and so ran itself to death.   
This story teaches us not to despise the poor man, because one day he may 
have an opportunity to put us to shame.   
From this story of the elephant we should learn this lesson; the Creator 
knows why He made some animals big and some small and why He made some men 
fools; so we should neither bully nor cheat men who happen to be born 
stupid.
