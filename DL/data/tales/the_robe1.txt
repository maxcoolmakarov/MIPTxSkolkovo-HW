The Hodja, bruised and limping, came upon a neighbor at the 
marketplace.  
 "My dear friend, what happened to you?" asked the neighbor.  
 The Hodja answered, "Last night my wife grew angry and kicked my robe 
down the stairs."  
 "But how could that have caused your injuries?" continued the neighbor. 
 
 "I was wearing the robe when she kicked it down the stairs," explained 
the Hodja.
