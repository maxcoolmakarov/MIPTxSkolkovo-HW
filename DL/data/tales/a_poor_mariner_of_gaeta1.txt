The generality of the common people of Gaeta get their living on the sea. One of them, an extremely poor mariner, after wandering here and there to make a little money, came home after nearly five years absence; he had left behind a very young wife and a most humble stock of furniture. So soon as he had set foot on land, he rushed home to see his wife, who, in the interval, despairing of his re turn, had taken to living with another man. On crossing the threshold, he notices that his house has been partly put in good repair, beautified and enlarged; wondering, he enquires of his wife how it has come to pass that their cottage, formerly so ugly, has become tidy and neat.  
"By the grace of God, who gives assistance to all men," replies the woman.  
"God be blessed," quoth the man, "for such kindness conferred upon us!"  
He next sees the bedroom, an elegant couch, and other furniture above his wife's condition, and again enquires where it all comes from.  
"The grace of God," says she.  
He returns anew thanks to the Lord for his great bounty. Other things meet his eyes, that are novel and unusual in his house; they also are the gift of God. He is at last feeling surprised at such favors lavished upon him, when a pretty little boy comes forward, more than three years old, who, infant-like, caresses his mother.  
The husband looking at the child and inquiring whose it is, the wife answers it is hers. Amazed, he asks how he can have come by that offspring whilst away; his wife asserts that it is also by the grace of God.  
Indignant at this superabundance of divine grace, which has gone the length of giving him heirs, "Indeed," says he, "I am under great obligations to God, who has taken such care of my interests!"  
It seemed to him that God had been rather too considerate in providing him with children during his absence.
