Once there was a proud vole (a kind of mouse) that wanted to marry, but would not have a bride from his own lineage, wanting instead the daughter of a most high being.  Thus he went to the sun, whom he held to be the mightiest being of all, and asked for the hand of his daughter.   
The sun replied, "But there is one even mightier than I: the cloud, for he is able to cover my brightness entirely."   
So the vole went to the cloud, addressed him as "the mightiest one," and asked to wed his daughter.   
The cloud responded that the vole would find an even stronger being in the wind, who had the power to push the cloud away at will.   
Next the vole journeyed to the wind, explaining that he understood him to be the most powerful creature of all, and wishing therefore to marry his daughter.   
"You are mistaken," answered the wind.  "The wall is stronger than I. He can withstand my mightiest blast."   
"Then I withdraw my request for you daughter's hand," replied the vole.  I will marry only into the mightiest family."  And he went forthwith to the wall.   
Upon hearing the vole's request to marry his daughter, and the explanations thereto, the wall replied, "You have been misled, my friend. There is a creature still mightier than I."   
"Who, then?" asked the vole.  "He must be the strongest in the world."   
"Quite so," said the wall.  "It's the mouse who has a nest inside of me. No mortar can withstand her gnawing. With time she'll be the death of me. However far you go, you'll find no better wife than this little lady mouse."   
And thus it is with the proud and the arrogant who strive beyond their rightful place, and end up even lower than where they started.
