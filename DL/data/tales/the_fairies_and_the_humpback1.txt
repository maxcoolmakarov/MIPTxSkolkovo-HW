A man who was a hump-back once met the fairies dancing, and danced with
their
queen; and he sang with them, "Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday," so well that
they
took off his hump, and he returned home a straight-bodied man. 
Then a tailor went past the same place, and was also admitted by the
fairies to
their dance.  He caught the fairy queen by the waist, and she resented his
familiarity.  And in singing he added "Thursday" to their song and spoilt
it. 
To pay the tailor for his rudeness and ill manners, the dancers took up
the hump
they had just removed from the first man and clapped it on his back, and
the
conceited fellow went home a hump-back.
