At Weinsberg, in WÃ¼rtemberg, are still shown on the summit of a hill the ruins of a castle, which is also known by the name of "Weibertreue," or "Woman's Faith." During the Guelph and Ghibelline wars the castle was in 1140 besieged by the Emperor Conrad III., who, in his exasperation at the protracted resistance made by the garrison, vowed to put all the men to the sword, but promised to spare the lives of the women, with the engagement, moreover, that each should be permitted to carry out along with her her choicest treasure.  
The offer was accepted, and each woman marched out with her husband on her shoulders.   
The tale is probably not much more authentic than that of Lady Godiva's self-abnegation, and is related of other places in Germany besides Weinsberg. A picture in the principal church, painted in the seventeenth century, represents the circumstances recorded in the legend; and about fifty years ago a society was instituted in the place with the double object of commemorating the heroic astuteness of the Weinsberg ladies in the olden time, and affording relief to poor women who had distinguished themselves by fidelity and self-denial.
