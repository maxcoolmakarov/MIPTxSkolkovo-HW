Once an oil man was going to market with his pots of oil arranged on a
flat basket, and he engaged a Santal for two annas to carry the basket.
And as he went along, the Santal thought: 
 
With one anna I will buy food and with the other I will buy chickens, and
the chickens will grow up and multiply, and then I will sell some of the
fowls and eggs, and with the money I will buy goats. And when the goats
increase, I will sell some and buy cows, and then I will exchange some of
the calves for she-buffaloes, and when the buffaloes breed, I will sell
some and buy land and start cultivation, and then I will marry and have
children, and I will hurry back from my work in the fields, and my wife
will bring me water, and I will have a rest, and my children will say to
me, "Father, be quick and wash your hands for dinner," but I will shake my
head and say, 'No, no, not yet!"
 
 And as he thought about it he really shook his head, and the basket
fell to the ground, and all the pots of oil were smashed. 
 Then the oil man abused him and said that he must pay two rupees for
the oil and one anna for the pots. But the Santal said that he had lost
much more than that, and the oil man asked him how that could be, and the
Santal explained how with his wages he was going to get fowls and then
goats and then oxen and buffaloes and land, and how he came to spill the
basket, and at that the oil man roared with laughter and said, "Well, I
have made up the account, and I find that our losses are equal, so we will
cry quits." And so saying they went their ways laughing.
