Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes 
Wherein our Savior's birth is celebrated, 
The bird of dawning singeth all night long: 
And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad; 
The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike, 
No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm, 
So hallowed and so gracious is the time. 
--Marcellus. 
 So have I heard and do in part believe it. 
--Horatio. 
 So says the immortal Shakespeare [ Hamlet , act 1, scene 1]; and
the truth thereof few nowadays, I hope, will call in question. Grose
observes, too, that those born on Christmas Day cannot see spirits; which
is another incontrovertible fact. 
 What a happiness this must have been seventy or eighty years ago and
upwards, to those chosen few who had the good luck to be born on the eve
of this festival of all festivals; when the whole earth was so overrun
with ghosts, boggles, bloody-bones, spirits, demons, ignis fatui,
brownies, bugbears, black dogs, specters, shellycoats, scarecrows,
witches, wizards, barguests, Robin-Goodfellows, hags, night-bats, scrags,

fiends, sibyls, nicknevins, whitewomen, fairies, thrummy-caps, cutties,
and nisses, and apparitions of every shape, make, form, fashion, kind and
description, that there was not a village in England that had not its own
peculiar ghost.  
 Nay, every lone tenement, castle, or mansion-house, which could boast
of any antiquity had its bogle, its specter, or its knocker. The churches,
churchyards, and crossroads were all haunted. Every green lane had its
boulder-stone on which an apparition kept watch at night. Every common had
its circle of fairies belonging to it. And there was scarcely a shepherd
to be met with who had not seen a spirit!
