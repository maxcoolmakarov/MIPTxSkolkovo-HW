There was once an old man in North Wales called Robin Ddu, or Black
Robin. He pretended to be a wizard, and though he had no magical power, he
was so cunning that he made people believe he had, and his fame spread
over the whole of Wales.  
 A lady in the Vale of Towy lost three precious gems. They had been
given to her by a dead sister, and she valued them all the more on that
account. Every search was made for them, but they could not be found.  
 The lady had not heard of the Well of Llanbedrog. (By means of that it
is quite easy to discover who has stolen your property. All you have to do
is to kneel by it, and after throwing in a bit of bread, name all whom you
suspect. When the thief's name is mentioned, the bread sinks.)  
 But she had heard of Black Robin, and at last she decided to send for
him. She dispatched a servant to North Wales to offer him fifty pounds if
he would restore her lost diamonds to her, and Robin traveled south with
the messenger. When he arrived, he said he would not begin his work unless
fifty pounds were given to him beforehand.  
 "Fifty pounds is a lot of money," said the lady. "I should like to test
your power before giving it you."  
 To this Robin reluctantly agreed. The lady put a tame robin redbreast
under a dish on the table. Sending for the supposed magician, she asked
him to say what was under the vessel. He did not know what to say or do,
and thought the best thing he could do was to confess his ignorance.  
 "Robin is caught," he said.  
 Thinking he referred to the bird and not to himself, the lady was
astounded at what she regarded as a wonderful display of power, and Robin
was too cunning to confess. The money was paid over, and the process of
finding the gems began.  
 First of all he inquired carefully into all the circumstances of the
disappearance of the gems, cross-examining all the inmates of the house
minutely. This investigation convinced him that one of the servants had
stolen them, but for some time he could not find out the actual thief.
 
 One day, as he was taking the air with one of the menservants, he
happened to enter the churchyard. The sexton in digging a grave had come
across a quantity of old bones, among them being a skull. Robin took the
skull back with him to his room, and his startled companion told the
servants' hall about it.  
 Then Robin called all the servants to him, and looking very stern,
"Tomorrow night," said he, "I will summon a legion of devils, and they
will punish the guilty with all the tortures of hell. But the innocent
shall not suffer with the guilty. Take these," and with this he handed to
each a tooth which he had wrenched from the skull. "By Friday morning" (it
was then Wednesday) "the guilty, after suffering unspeakable anguish and
pain, will be as dead as the body from which these teeth have been taken.
But I will not invoke my devils if the gems are brought to me before
midnight, nor will I disclose to any living soul who took them." 
 Sure enough, before midnight on Thursday a trembling maidservant
brought the diamonds to his room. The next thing to devise was how to
restore them to their owner without disclosing the manner in which hey had
been recovered, and at the same time in such a way as to reflect credit on
himself as a magician.  
 Looking out of his window in the morning he saw a flock of geese
feeding in a field not far from the mansion. Going out he took with him a
small piece of bread, in which he placed the stones. He threw the piece of
bread to the gander, which at once greedily swallowed it.  
 Some time after, summoning the lady, "Kill that gander," he said, "and
you will find inside him your lost treasure."  
 This was done and the diamonds were found.  
 "They were dropped on the floor and accidentally swept out with the
dust," he explained, "and this greedy bird swallowed them. By means of the
skull which the sexton dug out of the grave on Wednesday I was able to
divine the mystery."
