In preparation for prayers the Hodja performed his ablution in a 
swiftly running brook. Just as he was finishing the ceremonial washing, 
the stream carried away one of his shoes that had been on the bank near 
the water.  
 Angry at the loss of his shoe, the Hodja broke wind over the water, 
saying, "Brook, you can have back your ablution! Now give me back my 
shoe!"
