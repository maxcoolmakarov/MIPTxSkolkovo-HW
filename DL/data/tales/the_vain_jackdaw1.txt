Jupiter announced that he intended to appoint a king over the birds,
and named a day on which they were to appear before his throne, when he
would select the most beautiful of them all to be their ruler. Wishing to
look their best on the occasion they repaired to the banks of a stream,
where they busied themselves in washing and preening their feathers. The
jackdaw was there along with the rest, and realized that, with his ugly
plumage, he would have no chance of being chosen as he was. So he waited
till they were all gone, and then picked up the most gaudy of the feathers
they had dropped, and fastened them about his own body, with the result
that he looked gayer than any of them. 
 When the appointed day came, the birds assembled before Jupiter's
throne; and, after passing them in review, he was about to make the
jackdaw king, when all the rest set upon the king-elect, stripped him of
his borrowed plumes, and exposed him for the jackdaw that he was.
