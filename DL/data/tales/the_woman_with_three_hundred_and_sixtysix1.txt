Children 
  
Long, long ago, before the oldest stork was young and big deer and little 
fawns were very many in the Dutch forests, there was a pond, famous for 
its fish, which lay in the very heart of Holland, with woods nearby. 
Hunters came with their bows and arrows to hunt the stags. Or, out of the 
bright waters, boys and men in the sunshine drew out the fish with shining 
scales, or lured the trout, with fly-bait, from their hiding places. In 
those days the fish-pond was called the Vijver, and the woods where the 
deer ran, Rensselaer, or the Deer's Lair.   
So, because the forests of oak, and beech, and alder trees were so fine, 
and game on land and in water so plentiful, the lord of the country came 
here and built his castle. He made a hedge around his estate, so that the 
people called the place the Count's Hedge; or, as we say, The Hague.   
Even today, within the beautiful city, the forests, with their grand old 
trees, still remain, and the fish-pond, called the Vijver, is there yet, 
with its swans. On the little island, the fluffy, downy cygnets are born 
and grow to be big birds, with long necks, bent like an arch. In another 
part of the town, also, with their trees for nesting, and their pond for 
wading, are children of the same storks, whose fathers and mothers lived 
there before America was discovered.   
By and by, many people of rank and fortune came to The Hague, for its 
society. They built their grand houses at the slope of the hill, not far 
away from the Vijver, and in time a city grew up.   
It was a fine sight to see the lords and ladies riding out from the castle 
into the country. The cavalcade was very splendid, when they went hawking. 
There were pretty women on horseback, and gentlemen in velvet clothes, 
with feathers in their hats, and the horses seemed proud to bear them. The 
falconers followed on foot, with the hunting birds perched on a hoop, 
which the man inside the circle carried round him. Each falcon had on a 
little cap or hood, which was fastened over its head. When this was taken 
off, it flew high up into the air, on its hunt for the big and little 
birds, which it brought down for its masters. There were also men with 
dogs, to beat the reeds and bushes, and drive the smaller birds from 
shelter. The huntsmen were armed with spears, lest a wild boar, or bear, 
should rush out and attack them. It was always a merry day, when a hawking 
party, in their fine clothes and gay trappings, started out.   
There were huts, as well as palaces, and poor people, also, at The Hague. 
Among these, was a widow, whose twin babies were left without anything to 
eat -- for her husband and their father had been killed in the war. Having 
no money to buy a cradle, and her babies being too young to be left alone, 
she put the pair of little folks on her back and went out to beg.   
Now there was a fine lady, a Countess, who lived with her husband, the 
Count, near the Vijver. She was childless and very jealous of other women 
who were mothers and had children playing around them. On this day, when 
the beggar woman, with her two babies on her back, came along, the grand 
lady was in an unusually bad temper. For all her pretty clothes, she was 
not a person of fine manners. Indeed, she often acted more like a snarling 
dog, ready to snap at any one who should speak to her. Although she had 
cradles and nurses and lovely baby clothes all ready, there was no baby. 
This spoiled her disposition, so that her husband and the servants could 
hardly live with her.   
One day, after dinner, when there had been everything good to eat and 
drink on her table, and plenty of it, the Countess went out to walk in 
front of her house. It was the third day of January, but the weather was 
mild. The beggar woman, with her two babies on her back and their arms 
round her neck, crying with hunger, came trudging along. She went into the 
garden and asked the Countess for food or an alms. She expected surely, at 
least a slice of bread, a cup of milk, or a small coin.   
But the Countess was rude to her and denied her both food and money. She 
even burst into a bad temper, and reviled the woman for having two 
children, instead of one.   
"Where did you get those brats? They are not yours. You just brought them 
here to play on my feelings and excite my jealousy. Be gone!"   
But the poor woman kept her temper. She begged piteously and said: "For 
the love of Heaven, feed my babies, even if you will not feed me."   
"No! they are not yours. You're a cheat," said the fine lady, nursing her 
rage.   
"Indeed, Madame, they are both my children and born on one day. They have 
one father, but he is dead. He was killed in the war, while serving his 
grace, your husband."   
"Don't tell me such a story," snapped back the Countess, now in a fury. "I 
don't believe that any one, man or woman, could have two children at once. 
Away with you," and she seized a stick to drive off the poor woman.   
Now, it was the turn of the beggar to answer back. Both had lost their 
temper, and the two angry women seemed more like she-bears robbed of their 
whelps.   
"Heaven punish you, you wicked, cruel, cold-hearted woman," cried the 
mother. Her two babies were almost choking her in their eagerness for 
food. Yet their cries never moved the rich lady, who had bread and good 
things to spare, while their poor parent had not a drop of milk to give 
them. The Countess now called her men-servants to drive the beggar away. 
This they did, most brutally. They pushed the poor woman outside the 
garden gate and closed it behind her. As she turned away, the poor mother, 
taking each of her children by its back, one in each hand, held them up 
before the grand lady and cried out loudly, so that all heard her:   
"May you have as many children as there are days in the year."   
Now with all her wrath burning in her breast, what the beggar woman really 
meant was this: It was the third of January, and so there were but three 
days in the year, so far. She intended to say that, instead of having to 
care for two children, the Countess might have the trouble of rearing 
three, and all born on the same day.   
But the fine lady, in her mansion, cared nothing for the beggar woman's 
words. Why should she? She had her lordly husband, who was a count, and he 
owned thousands of acres. Besides, she possessed vast riches. In her great 
house, were ten men-servants and thirty-one maid-servants, together with 
her rich furniture, and fine clothes and jewels. The lofty brick church, 
to which she went on Sundays, was hung with the coats of arms of her 
famous ancestors. The stone floor, with its great slabs, was so grandly 
carved with the crests and heraldry of her family, that to walk over these 
was like climbing a mountain, or tramping across a ploughed field. Common 
folks had to be careful, lest they should stumble over the bosses and 
knobs of the carved tombs. A long train of her servants, and tenants on 
the farms followed her, when she went to worship. Inside the church, the 
lord and lady sat, in high seats, on velvet cushions and under a canopy. 
  
By the time summer had come, according to the fashion in all good Dutch 
families, all sorts of pretty baby clothes were made ready. There were 
soft, warm, swaddling bands, tiny socks, and long white linen dresses. A 
baptismal blanket, covered with silk, was made for the christening, and 
daintily embroidered. Plenty of lace, and pink and blue ribbons -- pink 
for a girl and blue for a boy -- were kept at hand. And, because there 
might be twins, a double set of garments was provided, besides baby 
bathtubs and all sorts of nice things for the little stranger or strangers 
-- whether one or two -- to come. Even the names were chosen -- one for a 
boy and the other for a girl. Would it be Wilhelm or Wilhelmina?   
It was real fun to think over the names, but it was hard to choose out of 
so many. At last, the Countess crossed off all but forty-six; or the 
following; nearly every girl's name ending in  je , as in our 
"Polly," "Sallie."

But before the sun set on the expected day, it was neither one boy nor one 
girl, nor both; nor were all the forty-six names chosen sufficient; for 
the beggar woman's wish had come true, in a way not expected. There were 
as many as, and no fewer children than, there were days in the year; and, 
since this was leap year, there were three hundred and sixty-six little 
folks in the house; so that other names, besides the forty-six, had to be 
used.   
Yet none of these wee creatures was bigger than a mouse. Beginning at 
daylight, one after another appeared -- first a girl and then a boy; so 
that after the forty-eighth, the nurse was at her wit's end, to give them 
names. It was not possible to keep the little babies apart. The thirty-one 
servant maids of the mansion were all called in to help in sorting out the 
girls from the boys; but soon it seemed hopeless to try to pick out Peter 
from Henry, or Catalina from Annetje. After an hour or two spent at the 
task, and others coming along, the women found that it was useless to try 
any longer. It was found that little Piet, Jan and Klaas, Hank, Douw and 
Japik, among the boys; and Molly, Mayka, Lena, Elsje, Annatje and Marie 
were getting all mixed up. So they gave up the attempt in despair. 
Besides, the supply of pink and blue ribbons had given out long before, 
after the first dozen or so were born. As for the, baby clothes made 
ready, they were of no use, for all the garments were too big. In one of 
the long dresses, tied up like a bag, one might possibly, with stuffing, 
have put the whole family of three hundred and sixty-six brothers and 
sisters.   
It was not likely such small fry of human beings could live long. So, the 
good Bishop Guy, of Utrecht, when he heard that the beggar woman's curse 
had come true, in so unexpected a manner, ordered that the babies should 
be all baptized at once. The Count, who was strict in his ideas of both 
custom and church law, insisted on it too.   
So nothing would do but to carry the tiny infants to church. How to get 
them there, was a question. The whole house had been rummaged to provide 
things to carry the little folks in: but the supply of trays, and mince 
pie dishes, and crocks, was exhausted at the three hundred and sixtieth 
baby. So there was left only a Turk's Head, or round glazed earthen dish, 
fluted and curved, which looked like the turban of a Turk. Hence its name. 
Into this, the last batch of babies, or extra six girls, were stowed. 
Curiously enough, number 366 was an inch taller than the others. To thirty 
house maids was given a tray, for each was to carry twelve manikins, and 
one the last six, in the Turk's Head. Instead of rich silk blankets a 
wooden tray, and no clothes on, must suffice.   
In the Groote Kerk, or Great Church, the Bishop was waiting, with his 
assistants, holding brass basins full of holy water, for the christening. 
All the town, including the dogs, were out to see what was going on. Many 
boys and girls climbed up on the roofs of the one-story houses, or in the 
trees to get a better view of the curious procession -- the like of which 
had never been seen in The Hague before. Neither has anything like it ever 
been seen since.   
So the parade began. First went the Count, with his captains and the 
trumpeters, blowing their trumpets. These were followed by the 
men-servants, all dressed in their best Sunday clothes, who had the crest 
and arms of their master, the Count, on their backs and breasts. Then came 
on the company of thirty-one maids, each one carrying a tray, on which 
were twelve manikins, or minikins. Twenty of these trays were round and 
made of wood, lined with velvet, smooth and soft; but ten were of 
earthenware, oblong in shape, like a manger. In these, every year, were 
baked the Christmas pies.   
At first, all went on finely, for the outdoor air seemed to put the babies 
asleep and there was no crying. But no sooner were they inside the church, 
than about two hundred of the brats began wailing and whimpering. Pretty 
soon, they set up such a squall that the Count felt ashamed of his progeny 
and the Bishop looked very unhappy.   
To make matters worse, one of the maids, although warned of the danger, 
stumbled over the helmet of an old crusader, carved in stone, that rose 
some six inches or so above the floor. In a moment, she fell and lay 
sprawling, spilling out at least a dozen babies. "Heilige Mayke" (Holy 
Mary!), she cried, as she rolled over. "Have I killed them?"   
Happily the wee ones were thrown against the long-trained gown of an old 
lady walking directly in front of her, so that they were unhurt. They were 
easily picked up and laid on the tray again, and once more the line 
started.   
Happily the Bishop had been notified that he would not have to call out 
the names of all the infants, that is, three hundred and sixty-six; for 
this would have kept him at the solemn business all day long. It had been 
arranged that, instead of any on the list of the chosen forty-six, to be 
so named, all the boys should be called John, and all the girls Elizabeth; 
or, in Dutch, Jan and Lisbet, or Lizbethje. Yet even to say "John" one 
hundred and eighty times, and "Lisbet" one hundred and eighty-six times, 
nearly tired the old gentleman to death, for he was fat and slow.   
So, after the first six trays full of wee folks had been sprinkled, one at 
a time, the Bishop decided to "asperse" them, that is, shake, from a mop 
or brush, the holy water, on a tray full of babies at one time. So he 
called for the "aspersorium." Then, clipping this in the basin of holy 
water, he scattered the drops over the wee folk, until all, even the six 
extra girl babies in the Turk's Head, were sprinkled. Probably, because 
the Bishop thought a Turk was next door to a heathen, he dropped more 
water than usual on these last six, until the young ones squealed lustily 
with the cold. It was noted, on the contrary, that the little folks in the 
mince pie dishes were gently handled, as if the good man had visions of 
Christmas coming and the good things on the table.   
Yet it was evident that such tiny people could not bear what healthy 
babies of full size would think nothing of. Whether it was because of the 
damp weather, or the cold air in the brick church, or too much excitement, 
or because there were not three hundred and sixty-six nurses, or milk 
bottles ready, it came to pass that every one of the wee creatures died 
when the sun went down.   
Just where they were buried is not told, but, for hundreds of years, there 
was, in one of The Hague churches, a monument in honor of these little 
folks, who lived but a day. It was graven with portraits in stone of the 
Count and Countess and told of their children, as many as the days of the 
year. Nearby, were hung up the two basins, in which the holy water, used 
by the Bishop, in sprinkling the babies, was held. The year, month and day 
of the wonderful event were also engraved. Many and many people from 
various lands came to visit the tomb. The guide books spoke of it, and 
tender women wept, as they thought how three hundred and sixty-six little 
cradles, in the Count's castle, would have looked, had each baby lived.
