In a remote village there lived a Brahman whose good nature and
charitable disposition were proverbial. Equally proverbial also were the
ill nature and uncharitable disposition of the Brahmani, his wife. But as
Paramêsvara (God) had joined them in matrimony, they had to live
together as husband and wife, though their temperaments were so
incompatible. Every day the Brahman had a taste of his wife's ill temper,
and if any other Brahman was invited to dinner by him, his wife, somehow
or other, would manage to drive him away. 
 One fine summer morning a rather stupid Brahman friend of his came to
visit our hero and was at once invited to dinner. He told his wife to have
dinner ready earlier than usual, and went off to the river to bathe. His
friend, not feeling very well that day, wanted a hot bath at the house,
and so did not follow him to the river, but remained sitting in the outer
verandah. If any other guest had come, the wife would have accused him of
greediness to his face and sent him away, but this visitor seemed to be a
special friend of her lord, so she did not like to say anything; but she
devised a plan to make him go away of his own accord. 
 She proceeded to smear the ground before her husband's friend with cow
dung, and placed in the midst of it a long pestle, supporting one end of
it against the wall. She next approached the pestle most solemnly and
performed worship ( pûjâ ) to it. The guest did not in
the least understand what she was doing, and respectfully asked her what
it all meant. 
 "This is what is called pestle worship," she replied. "I do it as a
daily duty, and this pestle is intended to break the head of some human
being in honor of a goddess, whose feet are most devoutly worshipped by my
husband. Every day as soon as he returns from his bath in the river, he
takes this pestle, which I am ordered to keep ready for him before his
return, and with it breaks the head of any human being whom he has managed
to get hold of by inviting him to a meal. This is his tribute
( dakshinâ ) to the goddess; today you are the victim." 
 The guest was much alarmed. 
 "What! break the head of a guest! I at any rate shall not be deceived
today," thought he, and prepared to run away. 
 The Brahman's wife appeared to sympathize with his sad plight, and
said, "Really, I do pity you. But there is one thing you can do now to
save yourself. If you go out by the front door and walk down the street my
husband may follow you, so you had better go out by the back door." 
 To this plan the guest most thankfully agreed, and hastily ran off by
the back door. 
 Almost immediately our hero returned from his bath, but before he could
arrive his wife had cleaned up the place she had prepared for the pestle
worship, and when the Brahman, not finding his friend in the house,
inquired of her as to what had become of him, she said in seeming anger,
"The greedy brute! he wanted me to give him this pestle -- this very
pestle which I brought forty years ago as a dowry from my mother's house,
and when I refused he ran away by the back yard in haste." 
 But her kind-hearted lord observed that he would rather lose the pestle
than his guest, even though it was a part of his wife's dowry, and more
than forty years old. So he ran off with the pestle in his hand after his
friend, crying out, "Oh Brahman! Oh Brahman! Stop please, and take the
pestle." 
 But the story told by the old woman now seemed all the more true to the
guest when he saw her husband running after him, and so he said, "You and
your pestle may go where you please. Never more will you catch me in your
house," and ran away.
