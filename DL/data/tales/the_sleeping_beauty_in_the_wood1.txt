There were formerly a king and a queen, who were so sorry that they had
no children; so sorry that it cannot be expressed. They went to all the
waters in the world; vows, pilgrimages, all ways were tried, and all to no
purpose.
 At last, however, the queen had a daughter. There was a very fine
christening; and the princess had for her godmothers all the fairies they
could find in the whole kingdom (they found seven), that every one of them
might give her a gift, as was the custom of fairies in those days. By this
means the princess had all the perfections imaginable.
 After the ceremonies of the christening were over, all the company
returned to the king's palace, where was prepared a great feast for the
fairies. There was placed before every one of them a magnificent cover
with a case of massive gold, wherein were a spoon, knife, and fork, all of
pure gold set with diamonds and rubies. But as they were all sitting down
at table they saw come into the hall a very old fairy, whom they had not
invited, because it was above fifty years since she had been out of a
certain tower, and she was believed to be either dead or enchanted.
 The king ordered her a cover, but could not furnish her with a case of
gold as the others, because they had only seven made for the seven
fairies. The old fairy fancied she was slighted, and muttered some threats
between her teeth. One of the young fairies who sat by her overheard how
she grumbled; and, judging that she might give the little princess some
unlucky gift, went, as soon as they rose from table, and hid herself
behind the hangings, that she might speak last, and repair, as much as she
could, the evil which the old fairy might intend.
 In the meanwhile all the fairies began to give their gifts to the
princess. The youngest gave her for gift that she should be the most
beautiful person in the world; the next, that she should have the wit of
an angel; the third, that she should have a wonderful grace in everything
she did; the fourth, that she should dance perfectly well; the fifth, that
she should sing like a nightingale; and the sixth, that she should play
all kinds of music to the utmost perfection.
 The old fairy's turn coming next, with a head shaking more with spite
than age, she said that the princess should have her hand pierced with a
spindle and die of the wound. This terrible gift made the whole company
tremble, and everybody fell a crying.
 At this very instant the young fairy came out from behind the hangings,
and spake these words aloud: "Assure yourselves, O King and Queen, that
your daughter shall not die of this disaster. It is true, I have no power
to undo entirely what my elder has done. The princess shall indeed pierce
her hand with a spindle; but, instead of dying, she shall only fall into a
profound sleep, which shall last a hundred years, at the expiration of
which a king's son shall come and awake her."
 The king, to avoid the misfortune foretold by the old fairy, caused
immediately proclamation to be made, whereby everybody was forbidden, on
pain of death, to spin with a distaff and spindle, or to have so much as
any spindle in their houses. About fifteen or sixteen years after, the
king and queen being gone to one of their houses of pleasure, the young
princess happened one day to divert herself in running up and down the
palace; when going up from one apartment to another, she came into a
little room on the top of the tower, where a good old woman, alone, was
spinning with her spindle. This good woman had never heard of the king's
proclamation against spindles.
 "What are you doing there, goody?" said the princess.
 "I am spinning, my pretty child," said the old woman, who did not know
who she was.
 "Ha!" said the princess, "this is very pretty; how do you do it? Give
it to me, that I may see if I can do so."
 She had no sooner taken it into her hand than, whether being very hasty
at it, somewhat unhandy, or that the decree of the fairy had so ordained
it, it ran into her hand, and she fell down in a swoon.
 The good old woman, not knowing very well what to do in this affair,
cried out for help. People came in from every quarter in great numbers;
they threw water upon the princess's face, unlaced her, struck her on the
palms of her hands, and rubbed her temples with Hungary-water; but nothing
would bring her to herself.
 And now the king, who came up at the noise, bethought himself of the
prediction of the fairies, and, judging very well that this must
necessarily come to pass, since the fairies had said it, caused the
princess to be carried into the finest apartment in his palace, and to be
laid upon a bed all embroidered with gold and silver.
 One would have taken her for a little angel, she was so very beautiful;
for her swooning away had not diminished one bit of her complexion; her
cheeks were carnation, and her lips were coral; indeed, her eyes were
shut, but she was heard to breathe softly, which satisfied those about her
that she was not dead. The king commanded that they should not disturb
her, but let her sleep quietly till her hour of awaking was come.
 The good fairy who had saved her life by condemning her to sleep a
hundred years was in the kingdom of Matakin, twelve thousand leagues off,
when this accident befell the princess; but she was instantly informed of
it by a little dwarf, who had boots of seven leagues, that is, boots with
which he could tread over seven leagues of ground in one stride. The fairy
came away immediately, and she arrived, about an hour after, in a fiery
chariot drawn by dragons.
 The king handed her out of the chariot, and she approved everything he
had done, but as she had very great foresight, she thought when the
princess should awake she might not know what to do with herself, being
all alone in this old palace; and this was what she did: she touched with
her wand everything in the palace (except the king and queen) --
governesses, maids of honor, ladies of the bedchamber, gentlemen,
officers, stewards, cooks, undercooks, scullions, guards, with their
beefeaters, pages, footmen; she likewise touched all the horses which were
in the stables, pads as well as others, the great dogs in the outward
court and pretty little Mopsey too, the princess's little spaniel, which
lay by her on the bed.
 Immediately upon her touching them they all fell asleep, that they
might not awake before their mistress and that they might be ready to wait
upon her when she wanted them. The very spits at the fire, as full as they
could hold of partridges and pheasants, did fall asleep also. All this was
done in a moment. Fairies are not long in doing their business.
 And now the king and the queen, having kissed their dear child without
waking her, went out of the palace and put forth a proclamation that
nobody should dare to come near it.
 This, however, was not necessary, for in a quarter of an hour's time
there grew up all round about the park such a vast number of trees, great
and small, bushes and brambles, twining one within another, that neither
man nor beast could pass through; so that nothing could be seen but the
very top of the towers of the palace; and that, too, not unless it was a
good way off. Nobody; doubted but the fairy gave herein a very
extraordinary sample of her art, that the princess, while she continued
sleeping, might have nothing to fear from any curious people.
 When a hundred years were gone and passed the son of the king then
reigning, and who was of another family from that of the sleeping
princess, being gone a hunting on that side of the country, asked:
 What those towers were which he saw in the middle of a great thick
wood?
 Everyone answered according as they had heard. Some said that it was a
ruinous old castle, haunted by spirits.
 Others, that all the sorcerers and witches of the country kept there
their sabbath or night's meeting.
 The common opinion was that an ogre lived there, and that he carried
thither all the little children he could catch, that he might eat them up
at his leisure, without anybody being able to follow him, as having
himself only the power to pass through the wood.
 The prince was at a stand, not knowing what to believe, when a very
good countryman spake to him thus: "May it please your royal highness, it
is now about fifty years since I heard from my father, who heard my
grandfather say, that there was then in this castle a princess, the most
beautiful was ever seen; that she must sleep there a hundred years, and
should be waked by a king's son, for whom she was reserved."
 The young prince was all on fire at these words, believing, without
weighing the matter, that he could put an end to this rare adventure; and,
pushed on by love and honor, resolved that moment to look into it.
 Scarce had he advanced toward the wood when all the great trees, the
bushes, and brambles gave way of themselves to let him pass through; he
walked up to the castle which he saw at the end of a large avenue which he
went into; and what a little surprised him was that he saw none of his
people could follow him, because the trees closed again as soon as he had
passed through them. However, he did not cease from continuing his way; a
young and amorous prince is always valiant.
 He came into a spacious outward court, where everything he saw might
have frozen the most fearless person with horror. There reigned all over a
most frightful silence; the image of death everywhere showed itself, and
there was nothing to be seen but stretched-out bodies of men and animals,
all seeming to be dead. He, however, very well knew, by the ruby faces and
pimpled noses of the beefeaters, that they were only asleep; and their
goblets, wherein still remained some drops of wine, showed plainly that
they fell asleep in their cups.
 He then crossed a court paved with marble, went up the stairs and came
into the guard chamber, where guards were standing in their ranks, with
their muskets upon their shoulders, and snoring as loud as they could.
After that he went through several rooms full of gentlemen and ladies, all
asleep, some standing, others sitting. At last he came into a chamber all
gilded with gold, where he saw upon a bed, the curtains of which were all
open, the finest sight was ever beheld -- a princess, who appeared to be
about fifteen or sixteen years of age, and whose bright and, in a manner,
resplendent beauty, had somewhat in it divine. He approached with
trembling and admiration, and fell down before her upon his knees.
 And now, as the enchantment was at an end, the princess awaked, and
looking on him with eyes more tender than the first view might seem to
admit of. "Is it you, my prince?" said she to him. "You have waited a long
while."
 The prince, charmed with these words, and much more with the manner in
which they were spoken, knew not how to show his joy and gratitude; he
assured her that he loved her better than he did himself; their discourse
was not well connected, they did weep more than talk -- little eloquence,
a great deal of love. He was more at a loss than she, and we need not
wonder at it; she had time to think on what to say to him; for it is very
probable (though history mentions nothing of it) that the good fairy,
during so long a sleep, had given her very agreeable dreams. In short,
they talked four hours together, and yet they said not half what they had
to say.
 In the meanwhile all the palace awaked; everyone thought upon their
particular business, and as all of them were not in love they were ready
to die for hunger. The chief lady of honor, being as sharp set as other
folks, grew very impatient, and told the princess aloud that supper was
served up. The prince helped the princess to rise; she was entirely
dressed, and very magnificently, but his royal highness took care not to
tell her that she was dressed like his great-grandmother, and had a point
band peeping over a high collar; she looked not a bit less charming and
beautiful for all that.
 They went into the great hall of looking-glasses, where they supped,
and were served by the princess's officers, the violins and hautboys
played old tunes, but very excellent, though it was now above a hundred
years since they had played; and after supper, without losing any time,
the lord almoner married them in the chapel of the castle, and the chief
lady of honor drew the curtains. They had but very little sleep -- the
princess had no occasion; and the prince left her next morning to return
to the city, where his father must needs have been in pain for him. The
prince told him that he lost his way in the forest as he was hunting, and
that he had lain in the cottage of a charcoal burner, who gave him cheese
and brown bread.
 The king, his father, who was a good man, believed him; but his mother
could not be persuaded it was true; and seeing that he went almost every
day a hunting, and that he always had some excuse ready for so doing,
though he had lain out three or four nights together, she began to suspect
that he was married, for he lived with the princess above two whole years,
and had by her two children, the eldest of which, who was a daughter, was
named  Morning , and the youngest, who was a son, they called
 Day , because he was a great deal handsomer and more beautiful than
his sister.
 The queen spoke several times to her son, to inform herself after what
manner he did pass his time, and that in this he ought in duty to satisfy
her. But he never dared to trust her with his secret; he feared her,
though he loved her, for she was of the race of the ogres, and the king
would never have married her had it not been for her vast riches; it was
even whispered about the court that she had ogreish inclinations, and
that, whenever she saw little children passing by, she had all the
difficulty in the world to avoid falling upon them. And so the prince
would never tell her one word.
 But when the king was dead, which happened about two years afterward,
and he saw himself lord and master, he openly declared his marriage; and
he went in great ceremony to conduct his queen to the palace. They made a
magnificent entry into the capital city, she riding between her two
children.
 Soon after, the king went to make war with the Emperor Contalabutte,
his neighbor. He left the government of the kingdom to the queen his
mother, and earnestly recommended to her care his wife and children. He
was obliged to continue his expedition all the summer, and as soon as he
departed the queen mother sent her daughter-in-law to a country house
among the woods, that she might with the more ease gratify her horrible
longing. 
 Some few days afterward she went thither herself, and said to her clerk
of the kitchen:
 "I have a mind to eat little Morning for my dinner tomorrow."
 "Ah! madam," cried the clerk of the kitchen.
 "I will have it so," replied the queen (and this she spoke in the tone
of an ogress who had a strong desire to eat fresh meat), "and will eat her
with a  sauce Robert ."
 The poor man, knowing very well that he must not play tricks with
ogresses, took his great knife and went up into little Morning's chamber.
She was then four years old, and came up to him jumping and laughing, to
take him about the neck, and ask him for some sugar candy. Upon which he
began to weep, the great knife fell out of his hand, and he went into the
back yard, and killed a little lamb, and dressed it with such good sauce
that his mistress assured him that she had never eaten anything so good in
her life. He had at the same time taken up little Morning, and carried her
to his wife, to conceal her in the lodging he had at the bottom of the
courtyard.
 About eight days afterward the wicked queen said to the clerk of the
kitchen, "I will sup on little Day."
 He answered not a word, being resolved to cheat her as he had done
before. He went to find out little Day, and saw him with a little foil in
his hand, with which he was fencing with a great monkey, the child being
then only three years of age. He took him up in his arms and carried him
to his wife, that she might conceal him in her chamber along with his
sister, and in the room of little Day cooked up a young kid, very tender,
which the ogress found to be wonderfully good.
 This was hitherto all mighty well; but one evening this wicked queen
said to her clerk of the kitchen, "I will eat the queen with the same
sauce I had with her children."
 It was now that the poor clerk of the kitchen despaired of being able
to deceive her. The young queen was turned of twenty, not reckoning the
hundred years she had been asleep; and how to find in the yard a beast so
firm was what puzzled him. He took then a resolution, that he might save
his own life, to cut the queen's throat; and going up into her chamber,
with intent to do it at once, he put himself into as great fury as he
could possibly, and came into the young queen's room with his dagger in
his hand. He would not, however, surprise her, but told her, with a great
deal of respect, the orders he had received from the queen mother.
 "Do it; do it" (said she, stretching out her neck). "Execute your
orders, and then I shall go and see my children, my poor children, whom I
so much and so tenderly loved," for she thought them dead ever since they
had been taken away without her knowledge.
 "No, no, madam" (cried the poor clerk of the kitchen, all in tears);
"you shall not die, and yet you shall see your children again; but then
you must go home with me to my lodgings, where I have concealed them, and
I shall deceive the queen once more, by giving her in your stead a young
hind."
 Upon this he forthwith conducted her to his chamber, where, leaving her
to embrace her children, and cry along with them, he went and dressed a
young hind, which the queen had for her supper, and devoured it with the
same appetite as if it had been the young queen. Exceedingly was she
delighted with her cruelty, and she had invented a story to tell the king,
at his return, how the mad wolves had eaten up the queen his wife and her
two children.
 One evening, as she was, according to her custom, rambling round about
the courts and yards of the palace to see if she could smell any fresh
meat, she heard, in a ground room, little Day crying, for his mamma was
going to whip him, because he had been naughty; and she heard, at the same
time, little Morning begging pardon for her brother.
 The ogress presently knew the voice of the queen and her children, and
being quite mad that she had been thus deceived, she commanded next
morning, by break of day (with a most horrible voice, which made everybody
tremble), that they should bring into the middle of the great court a
large tub, which she caused to be filled with toads, vipers, snakes, and
all sorts of serpents, in order to have thrown into it the queen and her
children, the clerk of the kitchen, his wife and maid; all whom she had
given orders should be brought thither with their hands tied behind them.
 They were brought out accordingly, and the executioners were just going
to throw them into the tub, when the king (who was not so soon expected)
entered the court on horseback (for he came post) and asked, with the
utmost astonishment, what was the meaning of that horrible spectacle.
 No one dared to tell him, when the ogress, all enraged to see what had
happened, threw herself head foremost into the tub, and was instantly
devoured by the ugly creatures she had ordered to be thrown into it for
others. The king could not but be very sorry, for she was his mother; but
he soon comforted himself with his beautiful wife and his pretty children.
 Moral 
Many a girl has waited long 
For a husband brave or strong; 
But I'm sure I never met 
Any sort of woman yet 
Who could wait a hundred years, 
Free from fretting, free from fears. 
Now, our story seems to show 
That a century or so, 
Late or early, matters not; 
True love comes by fairy-lot. 
Some old folk will even say 
It grows better by delay. 
Yet this good advice, I fear, 
Helps us neither there nor here. 
Though philosophers may prate 
How much wiser 'tis to wait, 
Maids will be a sighing still -- 
Young blood must when young blood will!
