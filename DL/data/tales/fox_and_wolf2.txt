A fox and a wolf found an old horse in a mire. They wanted to take it
with them and asked one another how they might manage. 
 The fox said, "You are the strongest. Tie the horse's tail around your
body and pull, while I prod the horse with a stick." 
 That happened, and soon the horse was out of the mud, but it then ran
off with the wolf tied to its tail. 
 "Claw your paws into the ground!" cried the fox. 
 "But I can see neither heaven nor earth!" answered the wolf. 
 Finally the wolf succeeded in breaking loose, and he and the fox
continued on their way, but without the horse.
