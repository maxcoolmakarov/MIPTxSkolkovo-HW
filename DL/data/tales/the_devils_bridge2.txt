A Swiss herdsman who often visited his girlfriend had either to make
his way across the Reuss River with great difficulty or to take a long
detour in order to see her.
 It happened that once he was standing on a very high precipice when he
spoke out angrily, "I wish that the devil were here to make me a bridge to
the other side!"
 In an instant the devil was standing beside him, and said, "If you will
promise me the first living thing that walks across it, I will build a
bridge for you that you can use from now on to go across and back. The
herdsman agreed, and in a few moments the bridge was finished. However,
the herdsman drove a chamois across the bridge ahead of himself, and he
followed along behind.
 The deceived devil ripped the animal apart and threw the pieces from
the precipice.
