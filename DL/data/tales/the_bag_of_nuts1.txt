It happened once that two young men met in a churchyard, about eight o'clock in the evening.   
One of them said to the other, "Where are you going?"   
The other answered, "I'm going to get a bag of nuts that lies underneath my mother's head in this churchyard. But tell me, where are you going?"   
He said, "I'm going to steal a fat sheep out of this field. Wait here till I come back."   
Then the other man got the nuts that were under his dead mother's head, and stood in the church porch cracking them.   
In those days it was the custom to ring a bell at a certain time in the evening, and just as the man was cracking the nuts the sexton came into the churchyard to ring it. But when he heard the cracking of the nuts in the porch he was afraid, and ran to tell the parson, who only laughed at him, and said, "Go and ring, fool."   
However, the sexton was so afraid, that he said he would not go back unless the parson would go with him. After much persuasion the parson agreed to go, but he had the gout very badly, and the sexton had to carry him on his back. When the man in the porch who was cracking the nuts saw the sexton coming into the churchyard with the parson on his back he thought it was the man who had just gone out to steal the sheep, and had returned with a sheep on his back. So he bawled out, "Is it a fat one?"   
When the sexton heard this he was so frightened that he threw the parson down and said, "Aye, and thou canst take it if thou lik'st."   
So the sexton ran away as fast as he could, and left the parson to shift for himself.   
But the parson ran home as fast as the sexton.
