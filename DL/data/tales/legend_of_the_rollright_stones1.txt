Not far from the borders of Gloucestershire and Oxfordshire, and within 
the latter county, is the pretty village of Rollright and near the 
village, up a hill, stands a circle of small stones, and one larger stone, 
such as our Celtic antiquaries say were raised by the Druids.    
As soon as the Druids left them, the fairies, who never failed to take 
possession of their deserted shrines, seemed to have had an especial care 
over these stones, and anyone who ventures to meddle with them is sure to 
meet with some very great misfortune.    
The old people of the village, however, who generally know most about 
these matters, say the stones were once a king and his knights, who were 
going to make war on the King of England. And they assert that, according 
to old prophecies, had they ever reached Long Compton, the King of England 
must inevitably have been dethroned, and this king would have reigned in 
his place. But when they came to the village of Rollright they were 
suddenly turned into stones in the place where they now stand.    
Be this as it may, there was once a farmer in the village who wanted a 
large stone to put in a particular position in an outhouse he was building 
in his farmyard, and he thought that one of the old knights would be just 
the thing for him. In spite of all the warnings of his neighbors he 
determined to have the stone he wanted, and he put four horses to his best 
wagon and proceeded up the hill. With much labor he succeeded in getting 
the stone into his wagon, and though the road lay down hill, it was so 
heavy that his wagon was broken and his horses were killed by the labor of 
drawing it home. Nothing daunted by all these mishaps, the farmer raised 
the stone to the place it was to occupy in his new building.    
From this moment everything went wrong with him. His crops failed year 
after year. His cattle died one after another. He was obliged to mortgage 
his land and to sell his wagons and horses, till at last he had left only 
one poor broken-down horse which nobody would buy, and one old crazy cart.  
  
Suddenly the thought came into his head that all his misfortunes might be 
owing to the identical stone which he had brought from the circle at the 
top of the hill. He thought he would try to get it back again, and his 
only horse was put to the cart. To his surprise he got the stone down and 
lifted it into the cart with very little trouble, and, as soon as it was 
in, the horse, which could scarcely bear along its own limbs, now drew it 
up the hill of its own accord with as little trouble as another horse 
would draw an empty cart on level ground, until it came to the very spot 
where the stone had formerly stood beside its companions.    
The stone was soon in its place, and the horse and cart returned home, and 
from that moment the farmer's affairs began to improve, till in a short 
time he was a richer and more substantial man than he had ever been 
before.

The old rhyme runs --  
 
If Long Compton thou can'st see,  
Then King of England thou shalt be.
