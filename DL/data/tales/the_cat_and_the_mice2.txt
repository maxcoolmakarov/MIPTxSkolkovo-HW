There was once a house that was overrun with mice. A cat heard of this,
and said to herself, "That's the place for me," and off she went and took
up her quarters in the house, and caught the mice one by one and ate
them. 
 At last the mice could stand it n longer, and they determined to take
to their holes and stay there. 
 "That's awkward," said the cat to herself. "The only thing to do is to
coax them out by a trick." So she considered a while, and then climbed up
the wall and let herself hang down by her hind legs from a peg, and
pretended to be dead. 
 By and by a mouse peeped out and saw the cat hanging there. "Aha!" it
cried, "You're very clever, madam, no doubt. But you may turn yourself
into a bag of meal hanging there, if you like, yet you won't catch us
coming anywhere near you."

 If you are wise you won't be deceived by the innocent airs
of those whom you have once found to be dangerous.
