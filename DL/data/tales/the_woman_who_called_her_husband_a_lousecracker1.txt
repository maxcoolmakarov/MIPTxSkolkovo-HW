There was a man who had an evil wife. When she got angry with him she called him a louse-cracker. This irritated him, especially when she did so in the presence of other people. He forbade her to this, under the threat of severe punishment, but this did not stop her.    
One time she called him thus, so he threw her into the pond in his garden. Drowning, and no longer able to speak, she raised both arms above the water and pressed her two thumbnails together, as though she were cracking lice. What she was not able to say with words she said with actions.
