A soldier related the following story, which is said to have happened to
his
grandfather.  The latter, the grandfather, had gone into the forest to cut
wood
with a kinsman and a third man.  People suspected that there was something
not
quite right about this third man, although no one could say exactly what
it
was. 
The three finished their work and were tired, whereupon the third man
suggested
that they sleep a little.  And that is what they did.  They all laid down
on the
ground, but the grandfather only pretended to sleep, keeping his eyes open
a
crack.  The third man looked around to see if the others were asleep, and
when
he believed this to be so, he took off his belt (or, as others tell the
story,
put on a belt) and turned into a wolf. 
However, such a werewolf does not look exactly like a natural wolf, but
somewhat
different. 
Then he ran to a nearby meadow where a young foal was grazing, attacked
it, and
ate it, including skin and hair.  Afterward he returned, put his belt back
on
(or took it off), and laid down, as before, in human form. 
A little later they all got up together and made their way toward home.
Just as
they reached the town gate, the third man complained that he had a
stomachache. 
The grandfather secretly whispered in his ear: "That I can well believe,
for
someone who has a horse, complete with skin and hair, in his belly." 
The third man replied: "If you had said that to me in the forest, you
would not
be saying it to me now."

A woman had taken on the form of a werewolf and had attacked the herd of a
shepherd, whom she hated, causing great damage.  However, the shepherd
wounded
the wolf in the hip with an ax blow, and it crawled into the brush.  The
shepherd followed, thinking that he could finish it off, but there he
found a
woman using a piece of cloth torn from her dress to stop the blood gushing
from
a wound.

At LÃ¼ttich in the year 1610 two sorcerers were executed because they
had
turned themselves into werewolves and had killed many children.  With them
they
had a boy of twelve years whom the devil turned into a raven whenever they
were
tearing apart and eating their prey.
