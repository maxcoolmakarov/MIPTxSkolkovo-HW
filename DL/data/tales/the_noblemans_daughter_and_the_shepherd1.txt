In a village between Eisenberg and Naumburg there lived a nobleman's daughter.  Nothing pleased her. One day she saw two dancing sows that a shepherd had obtained from a little gray man.  To get one of these pigs -- for the dancing sows finally made her happy -- she had shown the shepherd her birthmark, namely a golden hair on her right breast.   
Now she declared that she would marry whatever man could guess her birthmark, then herd three hundred hares, and finally say something true that no one else knew about.   
Our shepherd already knew about her birthmark, so he volunteered to herd the three hundred hares.  They were counted out to him, but he had scarcely gone into the open with them when they all scampered away from him. However, the little gray man gave him a flute, and when he blew into it every last one of the hares came running back to him.  
Now first the nobleman's daughter, then her mother, and finally her father -- all in disguise -- came to the shepherd to beg a hare from him. And each got one for a very high price, but when the shepherd blew into his flute the hares broke loose and ran back to him.     
Thus only the third task remained.   
The suitors were all invited to a gathering, but none of them, however noble they all were, was able to tell an unknown truth.   
Finally the shepherd rose from his seat in the back of the hall and began to relate what price he had received for the sale of the hares.  This was all terribly embarrassing for the noble maiden and her parents, so they finally declared the shepherd the winner, and he married the nobleman's daughter.
