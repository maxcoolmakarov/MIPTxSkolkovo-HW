A tambourinist had so contrary a wife, he never could get her to do anything he asked.    
One day, on their way to a wedding, at which he was to play, she was riding an ass and carrying his tambourine, and he cried out, as they were fording a river, "Woman, don't play the tambourine, for you'll frighten the ass."    
No sooner said than she began thrumming. The ass, shying, lost its footing, and threw our dame into the river; while the husband, however much he wished to help her, could do no good.    
Seeing she was drowned, he went upstream in search of her body.    
"My good fellow," said a looker-on, "what are you seeking?"    
"My wife," replied he, "who is drowned."    
"And you are looking for her upstream, friend?"    
"Oh, yes, sir, she was always contrary."
