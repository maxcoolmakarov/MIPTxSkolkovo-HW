Druidical circles and monoliths were looked upon with awe; and there were 
few that would have dared to remove them. 
Here is a tradition of a monolith on the farm of Achorrachin in 
Glenlivet.  The farmer was building a steading, and took the stone as a 
lintel to a byre door.  Disease fell upon the cattle, and most unearthly 
noises were heard during the night all round the steading.  There was no 
peace for man or beast. 
By the advice of a friend, the stone was taken from the wall and thrown 
into the river that ran past the farm.  Still there was no peace.  The 
stone was at last put into its old place in the middle of a field.  
Things then returned to their usual course. 
The stone stands to the present day in the middle of the field, and in 
some of its crevices were seen, not many years ago, small pieces of 
mortar.
