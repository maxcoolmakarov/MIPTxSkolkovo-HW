There was once a Brahman who had two wives. Like many Brahmans he lived
by begging and was very clever at wheedling money out of people. One day
the fancy took him to go to the marketplace dressed only in a small
loincloth such as the poorest laborers wear and see how people treated
him. So he set out, but on the road and in the marketplace and in the
village no one salaamed to him or made way for him, and when he begged no
one gave him alms. 
 He soon got tired of this and hastened home and, putting on his best
 pagri  [turban] and coat and  dhoti  [waistcloth], went back to
the marketplace. This time everyone who met him on the road salaamed low
to him and made way for him, and every shopkeeper to whom he went gave him
alms; and the people in the village who had refused before gladly made
offerings to him. 
 The Brahman went home smiling to himself and took off his clothes and
put them in a heap and prostrated himself before them three or four times,
saying each time, "O source of wealth! O source of wealth! It is clothes
that are honored in this world and nothing else."
