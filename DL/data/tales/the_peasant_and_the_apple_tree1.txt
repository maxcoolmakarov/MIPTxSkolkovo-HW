A peasant had an apple tree growing in his garden, which bore no fruit, 
but merely served to provide a shelter from 

the heat for the sparrows and grasshoppers which sat and chirped in its 
branches. Disappointed at its barrenness he 

determined to cut it down, and went and fetched his ax for the purpose. 
But when the sparrows and the grasshoppers saw 

what he was about to do, they begged him to spare it, and said to him, "If 
you destroy the tree we shall have to seek 

shelter elsewhere, and you will no longer have our merry chirping to 
enliven your work in the garden."    
He, however, refused to listen to them, and set to work with a will to cut 
through the trunk. A few strokes showed 

that it was hollow inside and contained a swarm of bees and a large store 
of honey. Delighted with his find he threw 

down his ax, saying, "The old tree is worth keeping after all."  
 Moral: Utility is most men's test of worth.
