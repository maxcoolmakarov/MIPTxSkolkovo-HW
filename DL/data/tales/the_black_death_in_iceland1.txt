At the time when the Black Death began to rage, it was the custom of a certain farmer to hold prayers every morning at all seasons of the year. On one occasion they were busy gathering the hay together, as it looked like rain, when the farmer said they would go home to prayers.  
Some of the others objected to this, and said it would be more fitting for them to get the hay in, but the farmer insisted, and they all went to the house.  
During the day there came in sight two tiny tufts of cloud, which came nearer and increased in size till at last they appeared as a man and a woman riding on grey horses.  
They rode along above the farm, and the woman was heard to say, "Shall we visit here?"  
"No," said the man, "that was not commanded us."  
So the Black Death passed over without coming to the farm, and all the people there survived.
