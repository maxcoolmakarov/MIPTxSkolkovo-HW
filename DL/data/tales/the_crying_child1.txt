In Krosnowo a servant girl had a child. In order to hide her shame she suffocated it immediately following its birth, then buried it in a turf shed. That same evening a man walked by the turf shed and heard pitiable crying. Others who passed this place experienced the same thing. People say that the poor child will have to continue crying until it is dug up and buried in a consecrated graveyard.
