One day Jack took the devil into a field of wheat, when it was springing 
up. He said, "Which will you have, the tops or the butts?"  
There was not much top to be seen, so the devil said he's have the butts. 
 
At harvest time Jack accordingly had the wheat, the devil the straw. 
Naturally he grumbled a good deal over such a bad bargain.  
Next year the field was sown with turnip seed, and Jack said, "You shall 
have tops this time."  
The devil agreed to this, and in due time Jack had the turnips, leaving 
his partner the green tops.  
After that they went to mow a field of grass, each one to have all the hay 
he could cut. They were to begin together in the morning. Jack got up in 
the night and put harrow tines in the grass on the side of the meadow 
where the devil was to mow.  
In the morning these notched and blunted the scythe, which was continually 
catching in them; but the "Old 'Un," thinking they were only burdocks, 
kept muttering, "Burdock, Jack! Burdock Jack!"  
Jack took no notice, and, mowing away diligently, secured nearly all the 
crop for himself once more.  
Then they went to threshing. Jack was to have bottoms this time, so he got 
the barn floor, and the devil went on top. He put up a hurdle [gate] for 
the devil to thresh on, and as he battered away Jack collected the corn 
[grain] on the floor.
