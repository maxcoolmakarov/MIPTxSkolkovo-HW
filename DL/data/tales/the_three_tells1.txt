According to the beliefs of the people and the shepherds who live in the
wild mountainous region surrounding the Waldst√§tter Lake in
Switzerland there is a cave in a cliff there where the three
redeemers -- they are called the three Tells -- are sleeping.  Dressed in
ancient costume, they will arise, come forth, and rescue their fatherland
when the need arises.  Only the very lucky have succeeded in finding the
entrance to the cave. 
A shepherd boy told the following story to a traveler:  His father,
looking for a lost goat among the cliffs, came upon this cave and entered
it.  As soon as he recognized the three sleeping men as the three Tells,
one of them rose up and asked:  "What time is it on earth?"  The
frightened shepherd answered:  "It is high noon."  The man replied:  "It
is not yet time for us to come," and went back to sleep.  The father
returned with his companions to awaken the Tells for the good of the
threatened fatherland, but although he looked repeatedly, he never again
found the cave.
