A man of middle age, whose hair was turning grey, had two mistresses, an 
old woman and a young one. The elder of the 

two didn't like having a lover who looked so much younger than herself; 
so, whenever he came to see her, she used to 

pull the dark hairs out of his head to make him look old. The younger, on 
the other hand, didn't like him to look so 

much older than herself, and took every opportunity of pulling out the 
grey hairs, to make him look young. Between 

them, they left not a hair in his head, and he became perfectly bald.
