In an excursion to the North of England, I was easily prevailed upon to 
see the  Luck of Edenhall ,* [*Edenhall, the antient seat of Sir 
Philip Musgrave, near Penrith, Cumberland] celebrated in a ballad of 
Ritson's Select Collection of English Songs. The only description I can 
give you of it is, a very thin, bell-mouthed, beaker glass, deep and 
narrow, ornamented on the outside with fancy work of coloured glass, and 
may hold something more than a pint.   
Antient superstition may have contributed not a little to its 
preservation; but that it should not, in a more enlightened age, or in 
moments of conviviality (see the Ballad), meet with one  gentle rap  
(and a gentle one would be quite sufficient for an  ordinary glass  
of the same substance), is to me somewhat wonderful. Superstition, 
however, cannot be entirely eradicated from the mind at once. The late 
agent of the family had such a  reverential regard  for this glass, 
that he would not suffer any person to touch it, and but few to see it . 
When the family, or other curious people, had a desire to drink out of it, 
a napkin was held underneath, less any accident should befall it; and it 
is still carefully preserved in a case made on purpose. The case is said 
to be the second, yet bears the marks of antiquity, and is charged with 
 ihs .   
Tradition, our only guide here, says, that a party of Fairies were 
drinking and making merry round a well near the Hall, called St. 
Cuthbert's well; but, being interrupted by the intrusion of some curious 
people, they were frightened, and made a hasty retreat, and left the cup 
in question: one of the last screaming out, 
 
If this cup should break or fall,   
Farewell the Luck of Edenhall.
