Once a Turtle lived in an inland lake, but stayed on the shore
most of the time. The Turtle always believed that there was no
one who could fool him.  
One day Nanbush was walking along the shore, when he saw a
pike in the water, which he decided to catch. He jumped in but
missed the fish, so he thought he would wash his hands and make
some soup. He went on and saw someone else in the water.   
He called out, "Well, my brother, is this where you live?"   
"Yes," the stranger answered, "This is where I live, and I am the chief."
 
Whereupon Nanbush said, "I never saw you before."   
Then the Turtle-chief said, "Tomorrow I expect to take part in a race and
I am betting my life on it."   
Nanbush asked him, "Whom are you going to race?" "I am going to race an elk," said the chief,
"and now I am going to get ready."  
He placed other turtles around the lake and told them what to
do, and then he was ready for the race.  
Nanbush saw the elk the next morning, and it looked very fat
and good to eat. He said to himself, "The Turtle will probably
give a feast after the race. I will be there and see who will win."  
Soon they were ready to start. By means of his brother turtles,
the chief won and the elk was beaten.   
Then the Turtle killed the elk. Nanbush stayed, hoping to get some of this meat, but the
Turtle said, "I am going to feed all my children and there will not
be enough meat to go around."   
Whereupon Nanbush proposed that he should carry the meat home for them. The Turtle agreed
to this and went home to wait for Nanbush. Nanbush, however,
took the meat to his own home and there ate it all.
