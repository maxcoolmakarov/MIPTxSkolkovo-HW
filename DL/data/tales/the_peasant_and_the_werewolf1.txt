One night a werewolf came upon a peasant who was driving his wagon
overland.  In
order to break its magic, the level-headed man unhesitatingly tied his
fire
steel to his whip and threw it over the wolf's head, keeping the whip in
his
hand.  However, the wolf seized the steel, and the peasant had to flee in
order
to save his life.
