The Fairy Faith in Celtic Countries  
Forty to fifty years ago, between St. John's and Foxdale [Isle of Man], a 
boy, with whom I often played, came to our house at nightfall to borrow 
some candles, and while he was on his way home across the hills he 
suddenly saw a little boy and a little woman coming after him.  If he 
ran, they ran, and all the time they gained on him.  Upon reaching home 
he was speechless, his hand were altered (turned awry), and his feet 
also, and his fingernails had grown long in a minute.  He remained that 
way a week.  
 
My father went to the boy's mother and told her it wasn't Robby at all 
that she saw; and when my father was for taking the tongs and burning the 
boy with a piece of glowing turf [as a changeling test], the boy screamed 
awfully.  Then my father persuaded the mother to send a messenger to a 
doctor in the north near Ramsey "doing charms," to see if she couldn't 
get Robby back.  As the messenger was returning, the mother stepped out 
of the house to relieve him, and when she went into the house again her 
own Robby was there.  
 
As soon as Robby came to himself all right, he said a little woman and a 
little boy had followed him, and that just as he got home he was 
conscious of being taken away by them, but he didn't know where they came 
from nor where they took him.  He was unable to tell more than this.  
Robby is alive yet, so far as I know; he is Robert Christian, of Douglas.
