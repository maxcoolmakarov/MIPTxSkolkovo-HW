There was a man who married a wife of whom he was very fond. But after
a while the wife died. Then the man wandered away in order to find a
country in which no one died. So he went from place to place, looking for
a town where there were no graves. At last he came to a town in the Sudan
where there were no graves. So he remained here, in the house of the
sheik. The sheik made a feast for him, and first offered him a piece of a
roasted leg. 
 "Where is your father?" asked the man. 
 "This is his leg," said the sheik, "the rest of him is up there,"
pointing to a shelf. 
 Then the man learned that when anyone fell ill, he was killed and
eaten, and that this was the reason there were no graves. So in the night
he ran away back to his own country.
