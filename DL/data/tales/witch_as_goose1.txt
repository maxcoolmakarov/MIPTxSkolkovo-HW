Some years ago at two o'clock in the morning the nightwatchman at Wertheim 
saw a goose walking next to him in the street. He caught it and took it 
to the guardhouse, where he locked it under a bench. The next morning, 
instead of the goose, a woman from Wertheim was lying there, which 
verified, as was already suspected, that she was a witch.
