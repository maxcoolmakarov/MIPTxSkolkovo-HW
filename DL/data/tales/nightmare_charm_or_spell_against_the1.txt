Mara 
 
 Pulling from my head the longest hair it possessed, and then going
through the pantomime of binding a refractory animal, the nurse slowly
chanted this spell:  
 De man o' meicht  
He rod a' neicht  
We nedder swird  
Nor faerd nor leicht,  
He socht da mare,  
He fand da mare,  
He band da mare  
Wi' his ain hair,  
An' made her swear  
By midder's meicht,  
Dat sh√∂ wad never bide a neicht  
What he had rod, dat man o' meicht.  
 There are different versions of this incantation, and I [Mrs. Saxby]
forget which it was that the old nurse used on the occasion mentioned.
Therefore I have given the one which is most familiar to me.
