In Japan, among superstitious people, evil dreams are believed to be
the result of evil spirits, and the supernatural creature called Baku is
known as Eater of Dreams.  
 The Baku, like so many mythological beings, is a curious mingling of
various animals. It has the face of a lion, the body of a horse, the tail
of a cow, the forelock of a rhinoceros, and the feet of a tiger.  
 Several evil dreams are mentioned in an old Japanese book, such as two
snakes twined together, a fox with the voice of a man, blood-stained
garments, a talking rice-pot, and so on.  
 When a Japanese peasant awakens from an evil nightmare, he cries:
"Devour, O Baku! devour my evil dream." At one time pictures of the Baku
were hung up in Japanese houses and its name written upon pillows. It was
believed that if the Baku could be induced to eat a horrible dream, the
creature had the power to change it into good fortune
