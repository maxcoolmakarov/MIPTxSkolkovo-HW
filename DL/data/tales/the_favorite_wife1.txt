Nasreddin Hodja's two wives were constantly asking him which one of 
them was his favorite.  
 "I love you both the same," was always his answer, but they did not 
accept this answer, and asked him repeatedly, "Which one of us do you love 
the most?"  
 Finally he secretly gave each of them a blue bead, privately 
instructing each woman that she should tell no one of the gift.  
 After that whenever either of the wives would ask him, "Which one of us 
is your favorite wife?" he would answer, "I love best the one to whom I 
gave the blue bead," and each was satisfied.
