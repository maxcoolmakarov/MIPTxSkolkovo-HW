A woman who died at Neu-Bukow in 1841 at the age of 118 told that when
she was a child underground people lived in a mountain near her home town
(the name is not given).  She herself and other children often saw them,
but they always ran away from them.  One night an underground man knocked
at their door and asked the mother to go with him.  His wife was in labor.
He also asked to borrow a kettle.  The mother went with him and was gone
the entire night.  She returned the next morning and reported that a
little boy had been born.
