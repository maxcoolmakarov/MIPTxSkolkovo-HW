Jupiter and the Monkey 
 
 
Jupiter issued a proclamation to all the beasts, and offered a prize to
the one who, in his judgment, produced the most beautiful offspring. Among
the rest came the monkey, carrying a baby monkey in her arms, a hairless,
flat-nosed little fright. When they saw it, the gods all burst into peal
on peal of laughter.   
But the monkey hugged her little one to her, and
said, "Jupiter may give the prize to whomsoever he likes. But I shall
always think my baby the most beautiful of them all."
