A dwarf appeared to the owner of the Halbhufe farm near Mount
Dittersberg, while he was working in his field. He asked him to tell
HÃ¼bel (a female dwarf) that Habel (a male dwarf) had died. The farmer
related this unusual incident at the dinner table, and even as he spoke, a
small woman, previously unseen, came into view in a corner of the room.
She ran crying from the room, and was never seen again.
