Werewolf 
 
 In a village there lived a woman whose first name was Trine. Her 
husband had been dead for a long time. The woman lived in impoverished 
circumstances, but nonetheless, she was always able to offer fresh meat to 
those who visited her.  
 One time a male relative came to visit her, and she offered him good 
fresh meat.  
 The man said to her, "Tell me, Trine, where did you get this nice 
mutton?"  
 Trine answered, "I'll show you. Just climb up onto the roof with the 
ladder that is leaning against the back of the house."  
 The man did what Trine asked him to do. In the distance he saw a herd 
of sheep. Suddenly a wolf came out of the brush, ran into the midst of the 
sheep, and was about to run away with one of them. The shepherd saw this 
in time, and with his dog took off after the wolf in order to rescue the 
sheep. The wolf defended itself.  
 The man on the roof, knowing what kind of wolf it was, called out, 
"Trine, watch out!"  
 Suddenly Trine was standing there in her true form. Then the shepherd 
began striking out at her with renewed vigor, and Trine was scarcely able 
to drag herself back home.
