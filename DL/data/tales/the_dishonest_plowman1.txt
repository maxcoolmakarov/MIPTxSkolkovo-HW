In Ehringen, a village between Wolfhagen and Volkmarsen, there once
lived a peasant who was hated and cursed by everyone, for it was his
custom to plow one or more furrows into his neighbors' fields whenever he
plowed his own lands, thus enriching himself.  However, after his death he
was punished for these acts.  Every night he is now damned to wander about
the fields that dishonestly enlarged in this manner.
