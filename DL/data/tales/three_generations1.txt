A seventy-year old man visited a doctor for a routine examination. 
Impressed with his patient's vitality and health, the doctor decided to 
ask him some questions about his lifestyle. After hearing responses about 
diet and exercise, the physician continued: "And may I also ask about your 
sexual activity?"  

"Of course," answered the seventy-year-old. "I usually have sex three 
times a week."  

"That's remarkable," said the doctor. "Would you happen to know how late 
in life your father remained sexually active?"   

"Oh, Dad? He's a bit of an embarassment to us. He's ninety, and he visits 
a prostitute every week."  

"Ninety!" exclaimed the doctor. "You do have good genes. How old was your 
grandfather when he died?"  

"Granddad? He's still alive. He's 110 and getting married next week."  

"Getting married at 110! Why does he want to get married at that age?"  

"Oh, he doesn't  want  to get married. He  has  to!"
