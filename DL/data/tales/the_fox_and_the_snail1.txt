One warm summer's day Master Fox was resting at Schw√§g Meadow. He
saw a snail next to him and immediately proposed a wager as to which of
them could run faster to St. Gallen. 
 "You're on!" said the snail, and set forth immediately -- a little
slowly to be sure, for he was carrying his house with him on his back, as
was his custom. 
 The fox, in contrast, continued his rest, intending to start off in the
cool of the evening, and he dozed off. The snail took advantage of this
circumstance and secretly crept into the fox's thick bushy tail. As
evening approached, the fox took off and was surprised that the snail was
nowhere to be seen. He presumed that he had covered a little bit of the
course already. 
 When he reached St. Gallen's gate and could still see nothing of the
snail, he turned around proudly and called out tauntingly, "Snail, are you
coming soon?" 
 "I'm already here!" answered the snail, for without being seen, he had
removed himself from the fox's tail and crept through the bottom of the
gate. 
 Thus the proud fox had to admit that he had lost.
