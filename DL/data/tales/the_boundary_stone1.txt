In Ulten there is a meadow called the "Schwemm." There is a crucifix in this meadow, and the old-timers tell the following legend about its origin and meaning:  
Two farmers formerly owned this meadow. One of them was not satisfied with with his portion and began a dispute about the boundary. He claimed that the boundary originally had been almost in the middle of his neighbor's current portion. He said that the boundary's location had been forgotten through the carelessness of the shepherds. The dispute was brought before a judge. Because neither party could present witnesses, the judge did not have an easy decision.  
Finally the accuser's greed drove him to swear an oath: "I swear that I have told the truth.  If I have told a lie, then may my head serve as a boundary stone!"  
The other farmer was terrified by such godless speech, and he said: "Neighbor, upon your oath I grant you the meadow. The future will show whether or not you have spoken the truth!"  
A short time later the untruthful farmer died, and the following day the shepherds found his head lying on the old legal boundary. They immediately recognized it as the head of the unjust neighbor.  News of this soon spread down to the village.   
The dead man's body had already been buried, and in order to clarify matters, the grave was re-opened. In the coffin the body was indeed lying there without a head.  The head was buried again with the body, but immediately it appeared back in the meadow.  Prayers and blessings did not help.  The head kept returning to the meadow until it finally decayed and fell to dust.   
The living neighbor once again took posession of his part of the meadow. He had a crucifix erected at the place where the head had formerly lain.
