The fox is the most crafty and cunning of beasts. His tricks and wiles
are innumerable. 
 If there are partridges about, he notices the direction in which they
will be likely to run, and then he runs ahead of them and lies down as if
dead, foaming at the mouth. When the birds come to the spot, they think
him dead, and peck at him. They dip their bills in the saliva running from
his mouth, and then he snaps at and catches them. 
 He one day played a similar trick on a peasant woman who was carrying a
basketful of live fowls to market. Seeing the way she was going, he ran
ahead and lay down as above described. When passing the spot she saw him,
but did not think it worth her while to stop and skin him. As soon as she
was out of sight the fox jumped up and, making a detour, again ran ahead
of her and lay down a second time in the road at a point she would have to
pass. 
 She was surprised to see him, and said to herself, "Has a pestilence
broken out amongst foxes? Had I skinned the first I saw lying by the
roadside it would have been worth my while to stop for this one, but as I
did not do so then, I shall not do so now." 
 She went on her way, and her surprise was unbounded when, after a
while, she noticed what she believed to be a third fox dead on the
roadside. 
 "Verily I have done wrong," thought she, "to neglect the good things
Allah has placed in my way. I shall leave my fowls here and secure the
pelts of the first two before the others take them." 
 No sooner said than done; but before she had time to return wondering,
but empty-handed, the cunning fox had secured his prey and departed.
