The cattle of the farmer living at Deunant, close to Aberdaron, were 
grievously afflicted with the "short disease," which is the malady known 
in English as the black quarter. Naturally, he thought they were 
bewitched. Old Beti'r Bont, whose character was by no means above 
suspicion -- she was thought to earn her living by stealing babies for the 
fairies -- had called at Deunant when they were feathering geese and had 
begged much for one, but she had been refused, and the farmer concluded 
she was taking her revenge by harassing his stock. So he went to old Beti 
and told her that he would tie her hands and feet and throw her into a 
river unless she removed the charm. She vehemently denied possessing any 
magical powers, and repeated the Lord's Prayer correctly in proof of her 
innocence. The farmer was not altogether convinced even by this, and made 
her say, "Rhad Duw ar y da," "God's blessing be on the cattle." Now, if 
this is spoken over bewitched animals, they are always freed from their 
disease, but the farmer's stock was no better even after his invocation, 
and he was at his wits' end.   
One night before going to bed he was standing a few steps in front of his 
house, meditating over his trouble. "I cannot imagine why the cattle do 
not get better," said he out loud to himself.   
"I will tell you," said a squeaky little voice close by him. The farmer 
turned in the direction of the sound and saw a tiny little man, looking 
very angrily at him. "It is," continued the manikin, "because your family 
keeps on annoying mine so much."   
"How is that?" asked the farmer, surprised and puzzled.   
"They are always throwing the slops from your house down the chimney of my 
house," said the little man.   
"That cannot be," retorted the farmer. "There is no house within a mile of 
mine."   
"Put your foot on mine," said the small stranger, "and you will see that 
what I say is true."   
The farmer, complying, put his foot on the other's foot, and he could 
clearly see that all the slops thrown out of his house went down the 
chimney of the other's house, which stood far below in a street he had 
never seen before. Directly he took his foot off the other's, however, 
there was no sign of house or chimney. "Well, indeed, I am very sorry," 
said the farmer. "What can I do to make up for the annoyance which my 
family has caused you?"   
The tiny little man was satisfied by the farmer's apology, and he said, 
"You had better wall up the door on this side of your house and make 
another in the other side. If you do that, your slops will no longer be a 
nuisance to my family and myself." Having said this he vanished in the 
dusk of the night.   
The farmer obeyed, and his cattle recovered. Ever after he was a most 
prosperous man, and nobody was so successful as he in rearing stock in all 
Lleyn. Unless they have pulled it down to build a new one, you can see the 
house with the front door at the back.
