In the year 1572, on January 22, a mother murderer from Gersdorf was
punished with red-hot pincers, first at the marketplace in Lauban, and
then at every cross street.  Afterward his right hand was cut off, then
his heart was pulled from his body, and finally he was quartered and the
four parts of his body were hung on four posts near the gallows.  The
cut-off hand was nailed up as well.  Although the birds pulled the other
pieces apart and ate them, they did not touch the hand.  Still entirely
uninjured, it was taken down and buried in the year 1577 before the
arrival of Emperor Rudolph II.
