Regarding the building of this [Kilgrim] bridge is the following
curious legend:
 Many bridges having been built on this site by the inhabitants, none
had been able to withstand the fury of the floods until his "Satanic
Majesty" promised to build a bridge which would defy the fury of the
elements, on condition that the first living creature who passed over
should fall a sacrifice to his "Sable Majesty."
 Long did the inhabitants consider, when the bridge was complete, as to
who should be the victim. A shepherd, more wise than his neighbors, owned
a dog called Grim. This man having first swum the river, whistled for the
dog to follow. Poor Grim unwittingly bounded across the bridge and thus
fell a victim to his "Sable Majesty."
 Tradition says, from this circumstance the spot has ever since been
known as Kill Grim Bridge.
