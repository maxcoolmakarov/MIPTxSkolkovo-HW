General Reference Works 
 

Folktale and fairy-tale researchers should not overlook general 
encyclopedias as sources for basic information about authors, collectors, 
movements, genres, and the like. 

The user-generated Internet encyclopedia  Wikipedia  
contains a wealth of information and is generally reliable.
