Witches are not popular in Ireland nowadays. They were generally old hags who by the evil power they possessed could charm away butter, or compound love-potions, or at most assume the form of a hare and suck the milk from their neighbor's cows before the sunlight touched the dew.   
There is a story common to every rural district in Ireland of a witch who was surprised in the act by a huntsman, and on being pursued by the dogs fled to a cabin where, having assumed her natural shape, she was discovered spinning, with the blood streaming from a wound in her side.
