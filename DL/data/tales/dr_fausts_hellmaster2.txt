According to legend, there is a book, named  Dr. Faust's Hell-Master,
 which teaches the art of controling spirits, even of making the devil
subservient to oneself. It is said to be buried beneath a thorn bush
behind the Chemnitz Castle, on the road to the KÃ¼ch Forest. Many
advocates of the black art have unsuccessfully attempted to find this
book.
