A fisherman, in the month  of May, stood angling on the bank of a river 
with an artificial fly. He threw his bait with 

so much art that a young trout was rushing towards it, when she was 
prevented by her mother. "Stop, child!" said she. 

"Never be too hasty where there is a possibility of danger. Take due time 
to consider, before you risk an action that 

may be fatal. How do you know whether that is indeed a fly, or the snare 
of an enemy? Let someone else make the 

experiment before you. If it be a fly, he will very probably elude the 
first attack, and then the second may be made 

if not with success, at least with safety."    
She had no sooner uttered this caution than a salmon seized upon the 
pretended fly, and was captured. 
 Moral: Do not rush into a strange position.
