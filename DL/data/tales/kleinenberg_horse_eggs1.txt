Once a man drove through Kleinenberg with a load of cannonballs. He was asked what they were, and he answered that they were horse eggs.  
The people of Kleinenberg were curious when they heard that, and asked if he would sell one to them. He said that he would be glad to do so, and then sold one to them for a large sum of money.  
He also told them how to hatch it: They would have to sit on it without interruption. They did just that, faithfully taking turns. But no foal appeared.   
Finally one of the sitters became impatient, stood up angrily, kicked against the egg with his foot, and cried out, "You cursed egg, won't you give it up?"  
Now they had been sitting on the crest of a hill, and when he kicked agains the egg it rolled down into a bush where a hare was seated. The frighted hare ran off, and the Kleinenberger thought that it was his foal. 
"Come back, Horsey!" he shouted.  
But Horsey the Hare could not be stopped, and he did not come back.
