The Denham Tracts 
A woman had a child that was remarkably puny.  It was voracious enough, 
"but put all the meat it got within an ill skin," and never grew any, and 
there were shrewd suspicions that it was a changeling.  One day a 
neighbor came running into her house, and shouted out, "Come here, and 
ye'll see a sight!  Yonder's the Fairy Hill a' alowe."
  
"Waes me! what'll come o' my wife and bairns?" screamed out the elf in 
the bed, and straightway made its exit up the chimney.
