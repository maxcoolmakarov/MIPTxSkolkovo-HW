The "Druidical" Stones at Rollright, Oxfordshire, are said to have been
originally a general and his army who were transformed into stones by a
magician.  The tradition runs that there was a prophecy or oracle which
told the general,--
 
If Long Compton thou canst see, 
King of England thou shalt be.
 
He was within a few yard of the spot whence that town could be observed,
when his progress was stopped by the magician's transformation,--
 
Sink down man, and rise up stone! 
King of England thou shalt be none.
 
The general was transformed into a large stone which stands on a spot from
which Long Compton is not visible, but on ascending a slight rise close to
it, the town is revealed to view. 
Roger Gale, writing in 1719, says that whoever dared to contradict this
story was regarded "as a most audacious freethinker." 
It is said that no man could ever count these stones, and that a baker
once attempted it by placing a penny loaf on each of them, but somehow or
other he failed in counting his own bread. 
A similar tale is related of Stonehenge.
