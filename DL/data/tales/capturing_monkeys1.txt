The mango trees [at Muddunpillay] were the resort of a great colony of monkeys, and we were told that the natives had caught many of them by placing on the ground coconuts in which holes had been cut, and which they had half filled with grain. These holes were only just large enough to admit the monkey's open hand. It was said that when Jockoo had grasped a good fistful of grain and could not withdraw it, the natives rushed out from an ambush close by, threw a  cumbly  (native blanket) over his head, and captured him, as he could not draw out his fist  full , and would not let go his lawful prize of grain!   
This is the story as told to us; but, in the interests of my veracity, I must say that we did not ourselves see the thing done.
