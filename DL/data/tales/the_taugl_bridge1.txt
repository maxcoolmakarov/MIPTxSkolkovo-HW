Next to the Taugl Mill a daring arched bridge made of huge stone blocks spans the Taugl River where its wild water has washed out a deep gorge.  
According to local tradition this bridge is not of human construction, but rather the work of the devil. Thus all who walk over it cross themselves so that the Evil One cannot harm them.   
Eighteen hundred years ago the devil made a pact with a miller's wife, promising her that he would build a bridge over the Taugl. If he could accomplish this before she gave birth to the child that she was then carrying under her heart, then this child would be his.  
When the child was born the bridge was finished except for one final stone that to this day is still missing in the arch. Thus the devil was defeated.  
Not wanting to return to hell empty-handed, he declared, "I have lost the child, but I shall take the first being that passes over the bridge."  
The miller's wife, a very clever woman, heard this and chased her big tomcat over the bridge. The devil grabbed the cat and took it with him into that deep hole where the Taugl flows downward, foaming with rage.
