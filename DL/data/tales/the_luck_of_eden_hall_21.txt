In this house (Eden Hall, a seat of the Musgraves), are some good 
old-fashioned, apartments. An old painted drinking glass, called the 
 Luck of Eden Hall , is preserved with great care. In the garden near 
to the house is a well of excellent spring water, called St. Cuthbert's 
Well. (The church is dedicated to that saint.) This glass is supposed to 
have been a sacred chalice; but the legendary tale is, that the butler, 
going to draw water, surprised a company of Fairies, who were amusing 
themselves upon the green near the well; he seized the glass which was 
standing upon its margin. They tried to recover it; but, after an 
ineffectual struggle, flew away, saying, 
 
If that glass either break or fall,  
Farewell the luck of Eden Hall.
