A young woman who lived on a farm became pregnant.  After giving birth
to the child she set it out to die of exposure, not an uncommon act in
this country before it became punishable by severe penalties.  Now one day
it happened that the young woman was invited to a dancing party.  However,
she had no good clothes, so she stayed at home in a sour mood.  That
evening, while milking the ewes in the fold, she complained aloud that for
the want of a proper dress she could not go to the party.  She had
scarcely spoken when she heard the following song:
 
Mother mine, in the fold, fold 
You need not be so sad, sad. 
You can wear my castoff rags, 
So you can dance, 
And dance.
 

The young woman who had let her child die of exposure thought that she
recognized its voice.  She took such a fright that she lost her mind and
remained insane the rest of her life.
