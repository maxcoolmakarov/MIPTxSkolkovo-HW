A man was riding home on his donkey, while his boy walked beside them. A 
traveler came along and said, "Father, it is not right for you to ride 
while you make your boy walk. You have stronger limbs."    
So the father climbed off the donkey and let his son ride. Another 
traveler came along and said, "Boy, it is not right for you to ride while 
you make your father go on foot. You have younger legs."    
So they both mounted the donkey and road on a little way. A third traveler 
came along and said, "How stupid! Two fellows on  one  weak animal. 
Someone should take a stick and knock you off its back!"    
So they both climbed off, and all three went along on foot, the father and 
son left and right, and the donkey in the middle. A fourth traveler came 
along and said, "You are three strange companions. Isn't it enough if two 
of you were to go on foot? Wouldn't it be easier if  one  of you 
would ride?"    
So the father tied the donkey's front legs together, and the son tied its 
back legs together. Then they put a strong pole that was lying beside the 
road through its legs and carried the donkey home on their shoulders.    
That's how far it can go if one tries to please everyone.
