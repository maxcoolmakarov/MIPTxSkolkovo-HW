Dere's a woman had one daughter an' one son. Dis boy coco-bay (leprosy) boy, an' he was an ol' witch too. Dis woman wouldn't allow da girl to court anybody, you know. So one day Bro' Boar-Hog came dere, properly dressed same as any gentleman. When he want to drop off his clothes, he had a song to sing.  
 
Da day when dis Bro' Boar-Hog come to see da daughter, the son tell his mother, "Ma, don' let sister marry to dis man, for he's a boar-hog!" Da mother drive him off, an' say dat he was rude. She say dat dis man was a gentleman. 
 
He tol' da mother, "All right! you will see." 
 
One day da mother give him some food to carry to dis man, all tied up nicely on a tray. When da boy reach to da yard, he got behind a tree. While he got behind da tree, he see dis boar-hog rooting' up de ground. An' dis boar-hog root all de ground, like ten men with forks. Dis boy stay behind da tree an' see all he do. When da boy see him, he wait a little; den da boy say, "Ahem!" 
  
Boar-Hog jump around; he start to say:
 
Indiana, Indiana, um, um!  
Indiana, Indiana, um, um!  
Indiana, Indiana, um, um! 
 
Dat caused his clothes to jump right on him according' as he sing da song. 
 
He step out, put his two hands in his pocket, an' say, "Boy, see how I plough up dis land!" He boast about da work he do on da field. Den he say to da boy, "How long you come?" 
 
Boy say, "Just come." 
 
He took da food an' carry it in da house, and tell da boy all right, he can go home. Da boy didn't go home. He got behind de tree again. When Bro' Boar-Hog t'ought da boy gone, he had a long trough, and he dump all de food in da trough. He t'row a bucket a water in too. 
 
Den, when he done, he start to say:
 
Indiana, Indiana, um, um!  
Indiana, Indiana, um, um!  
Indiana, Indiana, um, um! 
 
An' all his clothes drop off. He went in da trough. All dat time da boy watchin' him, you know. 
 
Boy start for home now, an' tell his mother all what he see. Da grandfather tell him all right, dey'll catch him. De daughter an' mother didn't believe, but da grandfather believed. 
 
So dat same afternoon dis Bro' Boar-Hog came to da house all dressed up in frock-coat. As he come in da house, he start talkin' an' laughin' wid da mother an' daughter. During dis time da ol' man had his gun prepare. 
 
Little boy take up his fife an' start to play da same song:
 
Indiana, Indiana, um, um!  
Indiana, Indiana, um, um!  
Indiana, Indiana, um, um! 
 
Bro' Boar-Hog say, "What vulgar song dat boy singin'!" He start to movin'. He not able to keep still, 'cause his tail comin' out fast. Quick he say, "Stop it, stop it! Let's go out for a walk! Let's go out for a walk! I can't stay here." 
 
So dey all went out, -- da daughter, da mother, an' da grandfather. After dey was goin' on, dey was talkin' when Bro' Boar-Hog look back, he see da boy was comin'. 
 
He say, "Where dat boy goin', where he goin'? Turn him back. I don't want to be in his company." 
 
So da grandfather tol' him let da boy alone, let him go for a walk too.  
 
Grandfather say, "Play, boy! Play, boy!" 
 
Da boy start:
 
Indiana, Indiana, um, um!  
Indiana, Indiana, um, um!  
Indiana, Indiana, um, um! 
 
His beaver drop off. Den he play on again da same song: his coat drop, his shirt drop. All drop save his pant.
  
Da ol' man tell him, "Play, boy! play, play, play!" 
 
An' his pant drop off. Dey see his long tail show, an' he start to run. Da ol' man point da gun at him an' shoot him dead.
 
And I went through Miss Havercomb alley,  
And I see a lead was bending;  
So the lead ben',  
So the story en'.
