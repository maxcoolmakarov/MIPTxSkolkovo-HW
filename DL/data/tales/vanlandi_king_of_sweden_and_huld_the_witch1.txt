Woman 
 Ynglinga Saga  of Snorri Sturluson 
 Svegdir's son was named Vanlandi, and he took the kingdom after him and
ruled over the Wealth of Uppsala. He was a great warrior and went far over
the land. He had stayed one winter in Finland with Sn√¶ the Old, and
there married his daughter Driva. In the spring he went away, whilst Driva
stayed behind, and he promised to come back after three winters, but he
came not for ten winters. 
 Then Driva had Huld the witch woman called to her, and sent Visbur,
hers and Vanlandi's son, to Sweden. Driva paid Huld the witch woman to
draw Vanlandi to Finland with sorcery or else to kill him. When the spell
was being furthered, Vanlandi was in Uppsala, and he had a longing to go
to Finland, but his friends and advisers forbade him, and said that it
certainly was Finnish witchcraft which caused his wanderlust. Then he
became sleepy and said that the Mare was treading on him. His men sprang
up and would help him, but when they came to his head she trod on his
feet, so that they were nigh broken; then they resorted to the feet, but
then she smothered the head, so that he died there. The Swedes took his
body and burned it near a river which was called Skuta; there was his
standing-stone set up. Thus says Tjodolv: 
 But on the way 
To Vili's brother 
Evil wights 
Bore Vanlandi; 
Then there trod 
The troll-wise 
Sorceress 
On the warrior lord. 
And there was burned 
On the Skuta bank 
That generous man 
Whom the Mare killed.
