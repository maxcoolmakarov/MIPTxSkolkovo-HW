The Book of Hell's Charms is in the church at Zellerfeld, secured 
by an iron chain. It was written by Doctor Faust. Only a few people can 
read it, and it is extremely dangerous to read it. To read it without 
losing one's life, one must be able to read it forwards and backwards.  
If one reads it forwards, the devil will appear. If one reads it 
backwards, he will leave. If anyone has read the Book of Hell's Charms 
forwards and cannot read it backwards, then the devil will do the rest.
