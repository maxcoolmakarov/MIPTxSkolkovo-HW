Once upon a time there was an old man, and an old woman, and a little
boy. One morning the old woman made a Johnny-Cake and put it in the oven
to bake. 
 "You watch the Johnny-Cake while your father and I go out to work in
the garden." 
 So the old man and the old woman went out and began to hoe potatoes and
left the little boy to tend the oven. But he didn't watch it all the time,
and all of a sudden he heard a noise, and he looked up and the oven door
popped open, and out of the oven jumped Johnny-Cake and went rolling along
end over end towards the open door of the house. 
 The little boy ran to shut the door, but Johnny-Cake was too quick for
him and rolled through the door, down the steps, and out into the road
long before the little boy could catch him. The little boy ran after him
as fast as he could lip it, crying out to his father and mother, who heard
the uproar and threw down their hoes and gave chase too. But Johnny-Cake
outran all three a long way, and was soon out of sight, while they had to
sit down, all out of breath, on a bank to rest. 
 On went Johnny-Cake, and by and by he came to two well-diggers, who
looked up from their work and called out, "Where are you going,
Johnny-Cake?" 
 He said, "I have outrun an old man and an old woman and a little boy,
and I can outrun you too-o-o!" 
 "Ye can, can ye?" We'll see about that!" said they, and they threw down
their picks and ran after him, but couldn't catch up with him, and soon
they had to sit down by the roadside to rest. 
 On ran Johnny-Cake, and by and by he came to two ditch-diggers who were
digging a ditch. "Where ye going, Johnny-Cake?" said they. 
 He said, "I've outrun an old man and an old woman and a little boy and
two well-diggers, and I can outrun you too-o-o!" 
 "Ye can, can ye? We'll see about that!" said they, and they threw down
their spades and ran after him too. But Johnny-Cake soon outstripped them
also, and seeing they could never catch him, they gave up the chase and
sat down to rest. 
 On went Johnny-Cake, and by and by he came to a bear. The bear said,
"Where are ye going, Johnny-Cake?" 
 He said, "I've outrun an old man and an old woman and a little boy and
two well-diggers and two ditch-diggers, and I can outrun you too-o-o!" 
 "Ye can, can ye?" growled the bear. "We'll see about that!" and trotted
as fast as his legs could carry him after Johnny-Cake, who never stopped
to look behind him. Before long the bear was left so far behind that he
saw he might as well give up the hunt first as last, so he stretched
himself out by the roadside to rest. 
 On went Johnny-Cake, and by and by he came to a wolf. The wolf said,
"Where ye going, Johnny-Cake?" 
 He said, "I've outrun an old man and an old woman and a little boy and
two well-diggers and two ditch-diggers and a bear, an I can outrun you
too-o-o!" 
 "Ye can, can ye?" snarled the wolf. "We'll see about that!" And he set
into a gallop after Johnny-Cake, who went on and on so fast that the wolf
too saw there was no hope of overtaking him, and he too lay down to
rest. 
 On went Johnny-Cake, and by and by he came to a fox that lay quietly in
a corner of the fence. The fox called out in a sharp voice, but without
getting up, "Where ye going, Johnny-Cake?" 
 He said, "I've outrun an old man and an old woman and a little boy and
two well-diggers and two ditch-diggers, a bear, and a wolf, and I can
outrun you too-o-o!" 
 The fox said, "I can't quite hear you, Johnny-Cake. Won't you come a
little closer?" turning his head a little to one side. 
 Johnny-Cake stopped his race for the first time, and went a little
closer, and called out in a very loud voice,  "I've outrun an old man
and an old woman and a little boy and two well-diggers and two
ditch-diggers and a bear and a wolf, and I can outrun you too-o-o!" 
 "Can't quite hear you. Won't you come a  little  closer?" 
 Johnny-Cake came up close, and leaning towards the fox screamed out,
"I'VE OUTRUN AN OLD MAN AND AN OLD WOMAN AND A LITTLE BOY AND TWO
WELL-DIGGERS AND TWO DITCH-DIGGERS AND A BEAR AND A WOLF, AND I CAN OUTRUN
YOU TOO-O-O!" 
 "You can, can you?" yelped the fox, and he snapped up the Johnny-Cake
in his sharp teeth in the twinkling of an eye.
