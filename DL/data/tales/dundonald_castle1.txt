In Ayrshire, the following rhyme is prevalent, and is probably very
old: 
 Donald Din 
Built his house without a pin, 
 alluding to Dundonald Castle, the ancient seat of King Robert II, and
now the last remaining property in Ayrshire of the noble family who take
their title from it. According to tradition, it was built by a hero named
Donald Din, or Din Donald, and constructed entirely of stone, without the
use of wood, a supposition countenanced by the appearance of the building,
which consists of three distinct stories, arched over with strong
stonework, the roof of one forming the floor of another. 
 Donald, the builder, was originally a poor man, but had the faculty of
dreaming lucking dreams. Upon one occasion he dreamed, thrice in one
night, that if he were to go to London Bridge, he would become a wealthy
man. He went accordingly, saw a man looking over the parapet of the
bridge, whom he accosted courteously, and, after a little conversation,
entrusted with the secret of the occasion of his coming to London Bridge.
 
 The stranger told him that he had made a very foolish errand, for he
himself had once had a similar vision, which direct him to go to a certain
spot in Ayrshire, in Scotland, where he would find a vast treasure, and,
for his part, he had never once thought of obeying the injunction.  
 From his description of the spot, the sly Scotsman at once perceived
that the treasure in question must be concealed in no other place than his
own humble  kail-yard  [cabbage patch] at home, to which he
immediately repaired, in full expectation of finding it. Nor was he
disappointed; for, after destroying many good and promising cabbages, and
completely cracking credit with his wife, who esteemed him mad, he found a
large potful of gold coin, with the proceeds of which he built a stout
castle for himself, and became the founder of a flourishing family.
