I had a little husband,  
No bigger than my thumb,  
I put him in a pint pot,  
And there I bade him drum.  
I bought a little horse,  
That galloped up and down;  
I bridled him, and saddled him,  
And sent him out of town.  
I gave him some garters,  
To garter up his hose,  
And a little handkerchief,  
To wipe his pretty nose.
