Baby, baby, naughty baby,  
Hush! you squalling thing, I say;  
Peace this instant! peace! or maybe  
Menschikoff will pass this way.  
Baby, baby, he's a giant,  
Black and tall as Rouen's steeple,  
Sups and dines and lives reliant  
Every day on naughty people.  
Baby, baby, if he hears you  
As he gallops past the house,  
Limb from limb at once he'll tear you  
Just as pussy tears a mouse.  
And he'll beat you, beat you, beat you,  
And he'll beat you all to pap;  
And he'll eat you, eat you, eat you,  
Gobble you, gobble you, snap! snap! snap!
