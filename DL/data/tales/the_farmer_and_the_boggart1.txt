T' boggart, a squat hairy man, strong as a six-year-old horse, and with 
arms almost as long as tackle poles, comes to a farmer who has just taken 
a bit of land, and declares that he is the proper owner, and the farmer 
must quit. The farmer proposes an appeal to the law, but boggart will have 
naught to do wi' law, which has never yet done him justice, and suggests 
that they should share the produce equally.   
"Very well," says the farmer, "wilt thou tek what grows above ground, or 
what grows beneath ground? Only, moind, thou mun stick to what thou 
sattles; oi doant want no back-reckunnings after."   
He arranges to take what grows above ground, and the farmer promptly sets 
potatoes. Of course, when the boggart comes at harvest time to claim his 
share he gets nothing but the haulms and twitch, and is in a sore taking. 
At last, however, he agrees to take all that grows beneath ground for next 
season, whereupon the farmer sows wheat, and when boggart comes round at 
t' backend, the man gets corn and straw, and naught is left for boggart 
but the stubble.   
Boggart then insists that next year wheat should be sown again, and that 
they should mow together, each taking what he mows. The farmer consults 
the local wise man, and studs boggart's "falls" with thin iron rods, which 
wear down boggart's strength in cutting and take all the edge of his 
scythe. So boggart stops to whet, and boggart stops to rest, but the 
farmer mows steadily on till at last the boggart throws down his scythe in 
despair and says, "Ye may tek t' mucky owd land an' all 'ats on it; I 
wean't hev no more to do wi' it."   
And off he goes and nivver comes back no more, leastways not after no 
land, but awms aboot t' delves, an' skears loane foaks o' noights; an' if 
thou leaves thy dinner or thy tools about, ofttimes he meks off wi' 'em.
