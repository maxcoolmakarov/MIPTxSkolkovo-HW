The stones of the beaver was once thought to be of use in medicine, and 
the animal was often hunted on that account. A 

shrewd old fellow of the race, being hard pressed by the dogs, and knowing 
well why they were after him, had the 

resolution and the presence of mind to bite off his stones and leave them 
behind him, and thus escaped with his life.  

 
 Moral: The skin is nearer than the cloak.
