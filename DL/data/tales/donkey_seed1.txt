In a small mountain village all the horses and donkeys died. Because the mules were immediately needed, the people got together and chose two men to go to Trento and ask the bishop for some donkey seed. This was done.  
The bishop politely listened to them, then said, "Come back this afternoon to get what you have requested."  
When they returned that afternoon he gave them a large pumpkin filled with seeds.  They put it on a donkey, thanked the bishop, and made their way homewards.  
High on the mountainside the donkey shied. The pumpkin fell to the ground and rolled down the mountain. It fell into a hare's nest, and the hares ran away.  
The two men shouted, "The donkeys are running away! They are running away!"  
They rushed to tell the others, and all together they ran off in search of the donkeys, but to this day they have not found them.
