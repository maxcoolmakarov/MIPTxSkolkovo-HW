When Christianity was introduced to RÃ¼gen, they wanted to build a
church in Vilmnitz.  However, the builders could not complete their task,
because whatever they put up during day was torn down again by the Devil
that night.  Then they purchased a child, gave it a bread-roll in one
hand, a light in the other, and set it in a cavity in the foundation,
which they quickly mortared shut.  Now the Devil could no longer disrupt
the building's progress.  

It is also said that a child was entombed in the church at Bergen under
similar circumstances.
