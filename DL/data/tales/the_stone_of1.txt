Odin   
A young man had seduced a girl under promise of marriage, and she proving
with
child, was deserted by him:  The young man was called before session; the
elders
were particularly severe.  Being asked by the minister the cause of so
much
rigor, they answered, "You do not know what a bad man this is; he has
broke the
promise of Odin."   
Being further asked what they meant by the promise of Odin, they put him
in mind
of the stone at Stenhouse, with the round hole in it; and added, that it
was
customary, when promises were made, for the contracting parties to join
hands
through this hole, and the promises so made were called the promises of
Odin.  
It was said that a child passed through the hole when young would never
shake
with palsy in old age.  Up to the time of its destruction, it was
customary to
leave some offering on visiting the stone, such as a piece of bread, or
cheese,
or a rag, or even a stone.  
The Odin stone, long the favorite trysting-place in summer twilights of
Orkney
lovers, was demolished in 1814 by a sacrilegious farmer, who used its
material
to assist him in the erection of a cowhouse.  this misguided man was a  
Ferry-Louper   (the name formerly given to strangers from the south),
and his
wanton destruction of the consecrated stone stirred so strongly the
resentment
of the peasantry in the district that various unsuccessful attempts were
made to
burn his house and holdings about his ears.
