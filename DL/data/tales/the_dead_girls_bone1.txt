Once there was a king who died. His wife and two children, a girl and a
boy, were still alive. Then one day they asked the mother which of them
should someday become king. She said to them, "Dear children, go out into
the woods together and look for a certain flower. The first one of you to
find it will someday become king."
 So the two set forth together, and while searching in the woods they
separated, and the girl was the first one to find the flower. She thought
she would wait for her brother, so she put the flower in her hand, closed
it in God's name, and lay down in the shade.
 Then the boy came to her. He had not found the flower, but when he saw
it in his sister's hand, a terrible thought came to him: "I will murder my
sister, take the flower home with me, and then I will become king."
 That is what he thought, and that is what he did. He killed her and
buried her in the woods, covering with earth so that no one would know
what had happened.
 Many years later a shepherd boy who was there tending his sheep found
one of the girl's bones lying on the ground. He made a few holes in it
like a flute, and blew into it. Then the bone began to sing ever so sadly
and told the entire story how the girl had been killed by her brother. To
hear the song would bring tears to your eyes.
 One day a knight came by where the boy was playing the flute. He bought
the flute and played it wherever he went in the land. Finally the old
queen heard the knight and became very sad. She had her son removed from
the throne, and she mourned for the rest of her life.
