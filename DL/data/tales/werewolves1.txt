Werewolf legends are well known.  According to them, many people possessed
the power to transform themselves into wolves by putting on a wolf belt.
They would then roam about at night attacking their enemies or their
enemies' cattle. 
In Fahrenholz in the year 1682 a number of people were accused of being
able to transform themselves into wolves and were put on trial. 
Only thirty years ago [in the 1840's] numerous examples of this kind of
magic were related in all children's rooms, although there have been no
wolves in Mecklenburg for more than one hundred years.  This proves how
widespread these legends formerly must have been.  
Beyer, in the  Meklenburgische Jahrb√ºcher  (20, 161), states
that "So far as I remember, in my youth I only heard of male werewolves,
never females.  However, in other regions gender makes no difference."
