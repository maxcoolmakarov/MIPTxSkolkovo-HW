In Caseburg on the island of Usedom a man and his wife were cutting hay in
a
meadow.  After a while the woman told the man that she was uneasy and
could not
stay there any longer, and she went away.  Earlier she had told him that
if a
wild animal were to come upon him he should throw his hat toward it and
run
away, and then no harm would come to him.  The man had promised her that
he
would do this. 
After the woman had been away for a while, a wolf swam across the Swina
and
approached the harvesters.  The man threw his hat at it, which the beast
immediately ripped into small pieces.  Meanwhile one of the workers crept
up to
the wolf with a pitchfork and stabbed it to death from behind.  Instantly
it was
transformed.  They were all astounded to see that it was the farmer's wife
that
the worker had killed.
