In the beginning there were no people on the earth.   
Lumawig, the Great Spirit, came down from the sky and cut many reeds. He 
divided these into pairs which he placed in different parts of the world, 
and then he said to them, "You must speak."   
Immediately the reeds became people, and in each place was a man and a 
woman who could talk, but the language of each couple differed from that 
of the others.   
Then Lumawig commanded each man and woman to marry, which they did. By and 
by there were many children, all speaking the same language as their 
parents. These, in turn, married and had many children. In this way there 
came to be many people on the earth.   
Now Lumawig saw that there were several things which the people on the 
earth needed to use, so he set to work to supply them. He created salt, 
and told the inhabitants of one place to boil it down and sell it to their 
neighbors. But these people could not understand the directions of the 
Great Spirit, and the next time he visited them, they had not touched the 
salt.   
Then he took it away from them and gave it to the people of a place called 
Mayinit. These did as he directed, and because of this he told them that 
they should always be owners of the salt, and that the other peoples must 
buy of them.   
Then Lumawig went to the people of Bontoc and told them to get clay and 
make pots. They got the clay, but they did not understand the molding, and 
the jars were not well shaped. Because of their failure, Lumawig told them 
that they would always have to buy their jars, and he removed the pottery 
to Samoki. When he told the people there what to do, they did just as he 
said, and their jars were well shaped and beautiful. Then the Great Spirit 
saw that they were fit owners of the pottery, and he told them that they 
should always make many jars to sell.   
In this way Lumawig taught the people and brought to them all the things 
which they now have.
