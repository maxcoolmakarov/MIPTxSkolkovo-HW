The russet dog and the wild dog (the fox and the wolf) were going
together. And they went round about the seashore, and they found a keg of
butter, and they buried it. 
 On the morrow the fox went out, and when he returned, he said that a
man had come to ask him to a baptism. The fox went, and he arrayed himself
in excellent attire, and he went away. And where should he go but to the
butter keg. And when he came home, the wolf asked him, "What name was
given to the child?" 
 And he said that it was Foveeal (under its mouth). 
 On the morrow the fox said that a man had sent to ask him to a baptism.
And he went to the keg, and he took out about half.  
 The wolf asked, when he came home, "What name was given to the
child?" 
 "Well," said he, "It is a queer name that I myself would not give to my
man child, if I had one. It is Moolay Moolay (about half and half)." 
 On the morrow the fox said that a man had come to ask him to a baptism
again. And he went to the keg, and he ate it all up. When he came home,
the wolf asked him, "What name was given to the child?" 
 And he said that it was Booill Eemlich (licking all up). 
 On the morrow the fox said to the wolf that they ought to bring the keg
home. They went, and when they reached the keg, there was not a shadow of
the butter in it. 
 "Well," said the fox, "you came here without me!" 
 The other one swore that he had not come near it. 
 "You need not be claiming that you did not come here. I know that you
did come, and that it was you who took the butter. And when we go home, I
will see if you ate the butter," said the fox. 
 When they arrived home, the fox hung the wolf by his hind legs, with
his head dangling below him. Then he put a dab of the butter under the
wolf's mouth, as though it had come out of the wolf's belly. 
 "You red thief!" said the fox. "I said before, that it was you who ate
the butter!"
