Here [in Cornwall], as in other English counties, Christmas customs are fast disappearing. Two of the favourite sports in Cornwall were a metrical play (exhibiting the successful prowess of St. George exerted against a Mahometan adversary) and a representation of some transactions at a market or fair.  
In the first, St. George entered, accoutred in complete armour, and exclaimed: 
 
Here come I, Saint George,  
That valiant champion bold,  
And with my sword and spear  
I've won three crowns of gold.  
I slew the dragon,  he ,  
And brought him to the slaughter  
By which I gained fair Sabea,  
The King of Egypt's daughter.  
 
The pagan then entered: 
 
Here come I, the Turkish knight,  
Come from the Turkish land to fight.  
 
Some more dialogue then ensued, and a fight took place, when the Turkish knight fell; recovering slowly he raised himself on one knee, and cried out: 
 
Oh! pardon me, Saint George;  
Oh! pardon me, I crave;  
Oh! give me but my life,  
And I will be thy slave.  
 
St. George again knocked him down, but immediately relenting, he called out, 
 
Is there no doctor to be found,  
To cure a deep and deadly wound?  
 
The Doctor now appeared on the scene with a small phial, which contained the juice of some particular plant, capable of recalling any one to life: he tried all his skill to restore the wounded, but failed. At this juncture St. George was supposed to kill the Doctor.  
Soon after, the Turkish knight appeared perfectly well, and having been fully convinced of his errors by the strength of St. George's arm, he became a Christian; and so the scene closed.
