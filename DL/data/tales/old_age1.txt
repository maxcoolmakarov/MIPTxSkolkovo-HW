In Scotland there are people who grow very old. Once a traveler came
upon an old man in his sixties who was crying. When asked what was wrong
with him, he said that his father had slapped his face. The stranger could
hardly believe that a man of his years would still have a living father
and that he would still be under his discipline. When asked why he had
been slapped, the man in his sixties said that he had carelessly dropped
his grandfather while helping him into his bed. Upon hearing this the
stranger asked to be taken to their house to see if the situation was as
the old man stated. 
 Yes, it was so. The boy was 62 years old, the father 96, and the
grandfather 130. Afterward, while recounting the story, the stranger told
how unusual it was to thus see 288 years together in one little room.
