A traveler came upon an old farmer hoeing in his field beside the road.  
The wanderer hailed the countryman, who looked up from his work. 
"How long will it take me to get to the next town?" asked the stranger. 
"I can't rightly say," was the farmer's curt reply. 
Insulted, the traveler strode off. 
"About an hour," shouted the farmer after him. 
"Why didn't you say so when I first asked?" 
"Because I didn't know how fast you were walking."
