Chuang-tzu saw a young woman in mourning vigorously fanning a newly
made grave. On his asking her the reason of this strange conduct, she
replied, "I am doing this because my husband begged me to wait until the
earth on his tomb was dry before I remarried!" 
 Chuang-tzu offered to help her, and as soon as he waved the fan once,
the earth was dry. The young widow thanked him and departed. 
 On his return home, Chuang-tzu related this incident to his wife. She
expressed astonishment at such conduct on the part of a wife. 
 "There's nothing to be surprised at," rejoined the husband. "That's how
things go in this world." 
 Seeing that he was poking fun at her, she protested angrily. 
 Some time after this Chuang-tzu died. His wife, much grieved, buried
him. 
 A few days later a young man named Chu Wang-sun arrived with the
intention, as he said, of placing himself under the instruction of
Chuang-tzu. When he heard that he was dead he went and performed
prostrations before his tomb, and afterward took up his abode in an empty
room saying that he wished to study. 
 After half a month had elapsed, the widow asked an old servant who had
accompanied Wang-sun if the young man was married. On his replying in the
negative, she requested the old servant to propose a match between them.
Wang-sun made some objections, saying that people would criticize their
conduct. 
 "Since my husband is dead, what can they say?" replied the widow. She
then put off her mourning garments and prepared for the wedding. 
 Wang-sun took her to the grave of her husband, and said to her, "The
gentleman has returned to life!" 
 She looked at Wang-sun and recognized the features of her husband. She
was so overwhelmed with shame that she hanged herself. Chuang-tzu buried
her in an empty tomb.
