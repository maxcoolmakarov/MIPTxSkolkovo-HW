One day a country mouse in his poor home  
Received an ancient friend, a mouse from Rome:  
The host, though close and careful, to a guest  
Could open still, so now he did his best.  
He spares not oats or vetches: in his chaps  
Raisins he brings and nibbled bacon-scraps,  
Hoping by varied dainties to entice  
His town-bred guest, so delicate and nice,  
Who condescended graciously to touch  
Thing after thing, but never would take much,  
While he, the owner of the mansion, sate  
On threshed-out straw, and spelt and darnels ate.  
At length the townsman cries: "I wonder how  
You can live here, friend, on this hill's rough brow:  
Take my advice, and leave these ups and downs,  
This hill and dale, for humankind and towns.  
Come now, go home with me: remember, all  
Who live on earth are mortal, great and small:  
Then take, good sir, your pleasure while you may;  
With life so short, 'twere wrong to lose a day."  
This reasoning made the rustic's head turn round;  
Forth from his hole he issues with a bound,  
And they two make together for their mark,  
In hopes to reach the city during dark.  
The midnight sky was bending over all,  
When they set foot within a stately hall,  
Where couches of wrought ivory had been spread  
With gorgeous coverlets of Tyrian red,  
And viands piled up high in baskets lay,  
The relics of a feast of yesterday.  
The townsman does the honours, lays his guest  
At ease upon a couch with crimson dressed,  
Then nimbly moves in character of host,  
And offers in succession boiled and roast;  
Nay, like a well-trained slave, each wish prevents,  
And tastes before the tit-bits he presents.  
The guest, rejoicing in his altered fare,  
Assumes in turn a genial diner's air,  
When hark! a sudden banging of the door:  
Each from his couch is tumbled on the floor:  
Half dead, they scurry round the room, poor things,  
While the whole house with barking mastiffs rings.  
Then says the rustic: "It may do for you,  
This life, but I don't like it; so adieu:  
Give me my hole, secure from all alarms,  
I'll prove that tares and vetches still have charms.
