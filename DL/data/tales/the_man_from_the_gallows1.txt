Late one evening an old woman received guests. She had no more food and 
did not know what she could cook for them. She went to the gallows where a 
dead man was hanging and cut out his liver.  This she fried for her 
guests, and they ate all of it.   
At midnight someone knocked on the door of her hut.  She woke up.  There 
stood the dead man. His head was naked; he had no eyes; and there was a 
wound in his body.  
 
"Where is your hair?"   
"The wind blew it off."   
"Where are your eyes?"   
"The ravens picked them out."   
"Where is your liver?"   
"You ate it."
