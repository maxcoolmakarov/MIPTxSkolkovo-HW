In the old convent church at Möllenbeck on the Weser River in the
district of Schaumburg there is a wooden statue of a female saint carrying
a church on her arm.  The legend states:
 Once Count Uffo was returning to his homeland following a long absence
in foreign lands.  While en route he dreamed that his wife Hildburg had
given birth to nine children in his absence.  Startled, he quickened his
pace.  
 Hildburg met him with joy and with the words, "I believed you were
dead.  But I have not been alone.  I have given birth to nine daughters,
and they are all dedicated to God."
 Uffo answered, "Your children are also my children.  I will care for
them."
 But they were nine churches, including the convent at Möllenbeck,
which the pious woman had built and endowed.
