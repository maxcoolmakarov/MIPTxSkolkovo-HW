Once upon a time the jackals assembled together to elect a king for 
themselves. The lions had a king. The tigers had a king. The leopards had 
a king. The wolves had a king. The dogs and other animals had their kings. 
So they thought that they too ought to appoint one, who should be their 
chief, who should guide them in counsel and lead them forth to war.  
 "Elect your king," cried the old jackal, anxious to begin the meeting. 
 
 Whereupon all the jackals shouted, "You are our king! You are our king! 
You are our senior in age and superior in experience. Who is there so fit 
as yourself to rule over us?"  
 And the old jackal consented, and by way of distinction allowed his fur 
to be dyed blue, and an old broken winnowing fan to be fastened round his 
neck.  
 One day the king was walking about his dominions attended by a large 
number of his jackal subjects, when a tiger suddenly appeared and made a 
rush at them. The whole company fled and forgot their old king. His 
majesty tried to escape into a narrow cave, but alas, his head stuck in 
the hole, by reason of the winnowing fan that was around his neck. Seeing 
their leader thus, the tiger came and seized him and carried him away to 
his lair, where it fastened him by a rope so that he could not run away. 
 
 In a short while, however, the jackal king did escape and get back to 
his subjects, who again wished him to be their king and to reign over 
them.  
 But the jackal had had enough of it, and therefore replied, "No thank 
you. I am quite satisfied. Once being a king is quite sufficient for a 
man's lifetime.
