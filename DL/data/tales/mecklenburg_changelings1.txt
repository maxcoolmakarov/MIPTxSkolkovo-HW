Legends, Tales, and Customs from Mecklenburg  
In RÃ¶vershagen the underground people once exchanged a woman's 
unbaptized child for one of their own.  Following the advice of a wise 
man, she laid the underground people's child on the chopping block as 
though she were going to kill it with an ax.  The dwarf's child 
immediately disappeared, and her own child was returned.
