The following legend is told about King Aistulf, who ruled the
Langobards in the middle of the eighth century: It is said that his mother
brought five children to the world in one hour's time. The king only
wanted to let one child live, and he said, "The child that takes hold of
my spear shall live. The other four shall be set out!" One child reached
out for the spear. The king named him Aistulf and allowed him to live.
