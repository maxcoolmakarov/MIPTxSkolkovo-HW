The Norwegians once made a sudden descent from their ships on the lower
end of Craignish. The inhabitants, taken by surprise, fled in terror to
the upper end of the district, and halted not until they reached the
 Slugan  (gorge) of  Gleann-Domhuinn , or the Deep Glen.  
 There, however, they rallied under a brave young man, who threw himself
at their head, and slew, either with a spear or an arrow, the leader of
the invaders. This inspired the Craignish men with such courage that they
soon drove back their disheartened enemies across Barbreck river. The
latter, in retreating, carried off the body of their fallen leader, and
buried it afterwards on a place on Barbreck farm, which is still called
DÃ¹nan-Amhlaidh, or Olav's Mound. The Craignish men also raised a
stone at Slugan to mark the spot where Olav fell.
