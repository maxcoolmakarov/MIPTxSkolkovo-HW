There was once a poor man whose wife had just given birth to a son.  
He wanted his child to have a just man as godfather, and he set out to find him.  
As he was walking, his stick in his hand, he first met a stranger, who looked like an honest man, and who asked him: "Where are you going, my good man?"  
-- I'm looking for a godfather for my new son.  
-- Well! Do you want me? I am at your disposal, if you please.  
-- Yes, but... I want a just man. 
-- Well! you could not have timed better; I am your man.  
-- So who are you?"  
-- I am the good Lord. 
-- You just? Lord God!... No! No! Everywhere on earth I hear people complaining about you.  
-- Why ist that, if you please?  
-- Why? For a thousand and a thousand different reasons.... Some complain because you sent them to this world weak, disabled, or sickly, while others are strong and full of health, but are not more deserving than the sickly ones. Furthermore, there are very honest people, I know more than one, who work like dogs continually, but you leave them poor and miserable, while their wasteful, heartless, good-for-nothing neighbors.... No, hold on, you won't be my son's godfather. Goodbye!... 
And the fellow went on his way, grumbling.  
A little further on he met a tall old man with a long white beard.  
"Where are you going, my good man?" asked the old man. 
-- Looking for a godfather for my newborn son.  
-- I'm quite willing to act as his godfather, if you like. Would that suit you?  
-- Yes, but I must tell you first that I want my son's godfather to be a just man.  
-- A just man? Well I am, I think.  
-- So who are you?  
-- Saint Peter. 
-- The gatekeeper of paradise, the one who holds the keys?  
-- Yes, that very one.  
-- Well! But you're not just either.  
-- "I am not just? Me!" replied Saint Peter with ill humor. "And, my good man, please tell me why not.  
-- Why not? Ah! I will tell you: I have been told that you refuse your door to honest people, hard-working men like myself for petty offences. And why? Because, after working hard all week, they may drink a pint too much of cider on Sundays,... and then, need I say any more? You are the prince of the apostles, the head of the Church, are you not?  
Saint Peter nodded, in agreement.  
-- Well, in your church it's like everywhere else: Nothing there is more important than money. The rich come before the poor like everywhere else.... No, you won't be my son's godfather either. Goodbye!...  
And he went on his way, still grumbling.  
He then met an unpleasant-looking fellow. He was carrying a large scythe over his shoulder, like a reaper going to his work.   
-- Where are you going, my good man?" the stranger asked him.  
-- To find a godfather for my newborn son.  
-- Do you want me as your godfather?  
-- First I must tell you that I want a just man.  
-- A just man! You will never find anyone more just than I am.  
-- Everyone tells me that. But who are you?  
-- I am Death.  
-- Ah, yes! You are really just. You have no preference for anyone, and you do your job honestly. Rich and poor, noble and common, king and subject, young and old, weak and strong.... You take them all when their time has come. You do not let yourself be softened or weakened by tears, threats, prayers, or gold. Yes, you are truly just, and you will be my son's godfather. Come with me.  
And the man returned to his cottage, taking with him the godfather he had chosen for his son.  
Death held the infant at the baptismal font, and afterwards there was a little meal in the poor man's cottage, where they drank cider and ate white bread, unlike their everyday fare.  
Before leaving, the godfather said to his friend: "You are very good people, your wife and you; but you are very poor! As you have chosen me to be the godfather of your son, I want to express my gratitude to you by revealing a secret that will make you earn a lot of money. You, friend, you are going to become a doctor now, and this is how you should behave: When you are called to a sick person, if you see me at the head of the bed, you can affirm that you will cure him, and give him anything as a remedy, even plain water. If you do so, he will always recover. If, to the contrary, you see me with my scythe at the foot of the bed, there will be nothing you can do. The patient will surely die, whatever you do to try to save him.  
Here, then, is our fake medical doctor, putting into practice the system of his friend Death, and predicting, always with certainty, when his patients will recover or die. Because he was never mistaken, and, moreover, because the remedies did not cost him dearly, since he only gave plain water to his patients, whatever the disease, he was highly sought after and soon became rich.  
However, Death, when he had occasion to pass by, came in from time to time to see his godson and talk with his friend.  
The child grew and developed wonderfully, but the doctor, to the contrary, grew older and weaker every day.  
One day Death said to him: "I always come to see you when I pass by here, but you've not yet come to my house. You must come and visit me, so that I can in turn be your host and show you my home."  
"I'm in no hurry to visit you," replied the doctor, "because I know that once someone is at your place, comrade, they don't come back the way they want to."  
-- Don't worry about that. I won't detain you until your time has come. You know that I am the most just of all men.  
So the doctor left one night to visit his friend. They went overland for a long time: over hill and dale, crossing arid plains, forests, rivers, rivers, and regions completely unknown to the doctor.  
Finally, Death stopped in front of an old castle surrounded by high walls, in the middle of a dark forest, and said to his companion: "It is here."  
They entered. The master of the gloomy manor first entertained his guest magnificently, then, on leaving the table, he led him into an immense room where millions of candles of all sizes were burning: long, medium, and short. They burned more or less steadily, and cast light more or less clearly. Our man was at first astonished, dazzled, and speechless before this spectacle.  
Then, when he could speak: "What do all these lights mean, my friend?" he asked. 
-- These are the lights of life, my friend.  
-- The lights of life? What do they mean?  
-- All humans who now live on earth have candles there, to which their lives are attached.  
-- But there are long ones, medium ones, short ones, bright ones, dull ones, dying ones... Why?  
-- Yes, it's like all human lives: some are just beginning; others are in their prime with all their brilliance; others are weak and wavering; others finally are about to die out....  
-- Why is this one so long and tall?  
-- It is that of a child who has just been born.  
-- And this other one, how brilliant and beautiful this light is!  
-- It is that of someone in the prime of life.  
-- Here's one that's going to die out for want of wax.  
-- He is an old man who is dying.  
-- And mine, where is it? I would like to see it.  
-- Here it is, near you.  
-- That one? Ah! My God, it is almost completely consumed! It will go out!  
-- Yes, you only have three more days to live!  
-- What are you saying? What, only three days!... But since I am your friend, and you are the master here, could you not make my candle last a little longer -- for example, by taking a little from that long one and adding it to mine?...  
-- The long one is your son's, and if I did as you are asking, I would no longer be the just person you were looking for.  
"That is true," replied the doctor, calming himself and heaving a deep sigh....  
And he then returned home, put his affairs in order, called the priest of his parish, and died three days later -- just as his friend Death had predicted.
