When Johha grew old enough to work for his living he became a donkey 
driver. One day, being in charge of twelve 
donkeys employed to carry earth to the city, it occurred to him, before 
starting with the laden animals, to count them. Finding the 
tale [tally] complete, he took them to their destination and unloaded 
them.  
 He then mounted one of them, and was going to return when he found one 
donkey missing. At once dismounting, he put 
them all in a row, and was astonished and greatly relieved to find the 
twelve there. He thereupon remounted and set off again, 
wondering as he rode along how it was that he had missed one donkey. 
Suddenly the suspicion flashed upon him that possibly 
the second count had been faulty, so he counted again, to find once more 
that only eleven were racing along in front of him. 
Terribly disconcerted, he again got down off the creature he was riding 
and, stopping the others, once more counted them. He 
was puzzled to find that there were again twelve.  
 So absorbed was he by this mystery, that he went on counting and 
recounting the donkeys till his master, surprised at his long absence, came and solved his difficulty by obliging him to follow his 
asses on foot.
