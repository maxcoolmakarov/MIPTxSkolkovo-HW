In the year 1257 a miraculous event occurred in the city of Erfurt. More
than 1000 children assembled there, and then all together they left the
city, dancing and singing. They went through the LÃ¶ber Gate and along
Steiger Way. They finally arrived at Arnstadt, where the citizens there
took them in. The people of Erfurt did not know where their children were
until the people of Arnstadt notified them. Then the people of Erfurt
brought their children back in carriages. No one ever discovered who had
led them away.
