After the flood, Old Man mixed water with different colors. He 
whistled, and all the people came together.  
 He gave one man a cup of one kind of water, saying, "You will be chief 
of these people here."  
 To another man he gave differently colored water, and so on. The 
Blackfoot, Piegan, and Blood all received black water.  
 Then he said to the people, "Talk," and they all talked differently; 
but those who drank black water spoke the same.  
 This happened on the highest mountain in the Montana Reservation [Chief 
Mountain?].
