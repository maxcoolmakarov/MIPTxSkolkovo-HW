There is an incredible tradition connected with this place, Ffinant,
Trefeglwys. It is said that an old barn stands on the right-hand side of
the highway.  
 One Sunday morning, as the master was starting to church, he told one
of the servants to keep the crows from a field that had been sown with
wheat, in which field the old barn stood. The servant, through some means,
collected all the crows into the barn, and shut the door on them. He then
followed his master to the church, who, when he saw the servant there,
began to reprove him sharply. But the master, when he heard the strange
news, turned his steps homewards, and found to his amazement that the tale
was true, and it is said that the barn was filled with crows. This barn
ever afterwards was called  Crow-Barn , a name it still retains. 
 It is said that the servant's name was Dafydd Hiraddug, and that he had
sold himself to the devil, and that consequently, he was able to perform
feats, which in this age are considered incredible. 
 However, it is said that Dafydd was on this occasion more subtle than
the old serpent, even according to the agreement which was between them.
The contract was, that the devil was to have complete possession of Dafydd
if his corpse were taken over the side of the bed, or through a door, or
if buried in a churchyard, or inside a church. Dafydd had commanded, that
on his death, the liver and lights were to be taken out of his body and
thrown on the dunghill, and notice was to be taken whether a raven or a
dove got possession of them; if a raven, then his body was to be taken
away by the foot, and not by the side of the bed, and through the wall,
and not through the door, and he was to be buried, not in the churchyard
nor in the church but under the church walls. And the devil, when he saw
that by these arrangements he had been duped cried, saying: 
 Dafydd Hiraddug, badly bred, 
False when living, and false when dead.
