A rich farmer by the name of Schlüntz lived a long time ago in
Vietlübbe.  One day he had gone to Lübz and was returning home
in the evening.  Upon entering a grove of fir trees, his horse refused to
proceed.  The farmer suddenly saw a wolf jump from the bushes and begin
snapping at the horse.  The horse ran off in a gallop, not stopping until
it had run out of breath.  The wolf caught up and jumped at it. 
The farmer knew that a neighbor of his had the reputation of being a
sorcerer, and just as the wolf was about to grab his horse by the neck, he
called out: "Irnst Jacobs, is that you?  Let me say something to you.
Irnst Jacobs, listen to me, Irnst Jacobs!"  And as he spoke the name the
third time, his neighbor stood there before him, begging him to high
heaven not to reveal him.  
The farmer let him go.  It had been the neighbor who had taken on the form
of a werewolf.
