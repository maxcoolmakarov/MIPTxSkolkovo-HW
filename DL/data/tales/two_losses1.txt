During a great storm at sea, a learned man heard the 
skipper giving his orders, but could not understand 
a word. When the danger was past, he asked the skipper 
in what language he had spoken.   
The sailor replied: "In 
my mother tongue, of course!"   
The scholar expressed his 
regret that a man should have wasted half his life without 
learning to speak grammatically and intelligibly. A few 
hours later the storm arose again, and this time the 
ship sprang a leak and began to founder. Then the captain 
went to the scholar and asked if he could swim.   
The man of books replied that he had never learned.   
"I am sorry, sir, for you will lose your whole life. The ship 
will go to the bottom in a minute, and my crew and 
I shall swim ashore. You would have done 
well if you had spent a little of your time 
in learning to swim."
