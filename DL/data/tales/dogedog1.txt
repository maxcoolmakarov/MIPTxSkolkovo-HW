Dogedog had always been very lazy, and now that his father and mother were
dead
and he had no one to care for him, he lived very poorly.  He had little to
eat. 
His house was old and small and so poor that it had not even a floor.
Still he
would rather sit all day and idle away his time than to work and have more
things. 
One day, however, when the rainy season was near at hand, Dogedog began
thinking
how cold he would be when the storms came, and he felt so sorry for
himself that
he decided to make a floor in his house. 
Wrapping some rice in a banana leaf for his dinner, he took his long knife
and
went to the forest to cut some bamboo.  He hung the bundle of rice in a
tree
until he should need it; but while he was working a cat came and ate it.
When
the hungry man came for his dinner, there was none left.  Dogedog went
back to
his miserable little house which looked forlorn to him even, now that he
had
decided to have a floor. 
The next day he went again to the forest and hung his rice in the tree as
he did
before, but again the cat came and ate it.  So the man had to go home
without
any dinner. 
The third day he took the rice, but this time he fixed a trap in the tree,
and
when the cat came it was caught. 
"Now I have you!" cried the man when he found the cat; "and I shall kill
you for
stealing my rice." 
"Oh, do not kill me," pleaded the cat, "and I will be of some use to
you." 
So Dogedog decided to spare the cat's life, and he took it home and tied
it near
the door to guard the house. 
Some time later when he went to look at it, he was very much surprised to
find
that it had become a cock. 
"Now I can go to the cock-fight at Magsingal," cried the man.  And he was
very
happy, for he had much rather do that than work. 
Thinking no more of getting wood for his floor, he started out at once for
Magsingal with the cock under his arm. 
As he was crossing a river he met an alligator which called out to him:
"Where
are you going, "Dogedog?" 
"To the cock-fight at Magsingal," replied the man as he fondly stroked the
rooster. 
"Wait, and I will go with you," said the alligator; and he drew himself
out of
the water. 
The two walking together soon entered a forest where they met a deer and
it
asked: "Where are you going, Dogedog?" 
"To the cock-fight at Magsingal," said the man. 
"Wait and I will go with you," said the deer; and he also joined them. 
By and by they met a mound of earth that had been raised by the ants, and
they
would have passed without noticing it had it not inquired: "Where are you
going,
Dogedog?" 
"To the cock-fight at Magsingal," said the man once more; and the mound of
earth
joined them. 
The company then hurried on, and just as they were leaving the forest,
they
passed a big tree in which was a monkey.  "Where are you going, Dogedog?"
shrieked the monkey.  And without waiting for an answer, he scrambled down
the
tree and followed them. 
As the party walked along they talked together, and the alligator said to
Dogedog: "If any man wants to dive into the water, I can stay under longer
than
he." 
Then the deer, not to be outdone, said: "If any man wants to run, I can
run
faster." 
The mound of earth, anxious to show its strength, said: "If any man wants
to
wrestle, I can beat him." 
And the monkey said: "If any man wants to climb, I can go higher." 
They reached Magsingal in good time and the people were ready for the
fight to
begin.  When Dogedog put his rooster, which had been a cat, into the pit,
it
killed the other cock at once, for it used its claws like a cat. 
The people brought more roosters and wagered much money, but Dogedog's
cock
killed all the others until there was not one left in Magsingal, and
Dogedog won
much money.  Then they went outside the town and brought all the cocks
they
could find, but not one could win over that of Dogedog. 
When the cocks were all dead, the people wanted some other sport, so they
brought a man who could stay under water for a long time, and Dogedog made
him
compete with the alligator.  But after a while the man had to come up
first. 
Then they brought a swift runner and he raced with the deer, but the man
was
left far  behind.  Next they looked around until they found a very large
man who
was willing to contend with the mound of earth, but after a hard struggle
the
man was thrown.  Finally they brought a man who could climb higher than
anyone
else, but the monkey went far above him, and he had to give up. 
All these contests had brought much money to Dogedog, and now he had to
buy two
horses to carry his sacks of silver.  As soon as he reached home, he
bought the
house of a very rich man and went to live in it.  And he was very happy,
for he
did not have to work any more.
