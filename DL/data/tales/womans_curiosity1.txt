A shepherd saved the life of the daughter of the king of snakes, the 
princess narrowly escaping being burnt to death. To show him her gratitude 
she taught him the language of animals, and he was able to understand 
them.  
One day his donkey said something that made him smile; whereupon his wife 
commenced to tease him, and wanted to know the joke, but the shepherd was 
unable to gratify her wish, as his betraying the secret would have 
immediately been followed by the penalty of sudden death. However the wife 
would not give in and leave him in peace, but continued to torment her 
husband with so many questions that he at last determined to die rather 
than to bear his wife's ill temper any longer.  
With this view he had his coffin made and brought to his house; he laid 
down in the coffin quite prepared for death and ready to divulge the 
secret.  
His faithful dog sat mournfully by his side watching, while the cock 
belonging to the house merrily hopped about in the room. The dog 
remonstrated with the cock and said that this was not the time for 
merriment, seeing how near their master was to death.  
But the cock replied quite curtly, "It's master's own fault! Why is he 
such a great fool and coward? Look at me! I have fifty wives, and they all 
do as I tell them to do! If I can get on with so many, surely he ought to 
be able to manage one!"  
Hearing this the shepherd jumped out of the coffin, seized a wet rope end 
and gave the woman a sound thrashing. Peace was restored, and they lived 
happily together ever after.
