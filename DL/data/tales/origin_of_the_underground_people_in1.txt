 The Lord Jesus came one day to a house where a woman lived who had five 
beautiful and five ugly children. She hid the five ugly children in the 
cellar. The Lord Jesus asked her where her other children were. The woman 
said: "I do not have any more children."  
 Then the Lord Jesus cursed the five ugly children, saying: "That which 
is beneath shall remain beneath, and that which above shall remain above!" 
 
 When the woman returned to the cellar, her five ugly children had 
disappeared. The underground people are their descendants.
