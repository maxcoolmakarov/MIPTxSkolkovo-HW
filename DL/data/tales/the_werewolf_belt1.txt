Formerly there were people who could turn themselves into wolves by
putting on a
certain belt.  A man in the vicinity of Steina had such a belt, and once
he went
away without locking it up, as was his custom.  His young son came upon it
and
buckled the thing about himself.  Instantly he became a werewolf.  He had
the
appearance of a stack of pea straw and lumbered away heavily like a
bear. 
When the people in the room saw what had happened they ran quickly and
brought
back the father.  He arrived barely in time and undid the strap before the
boy
could do any damage.  Afterward the boy said that as soon as he put the
belt on,
he become so terribly hungry that he would have torn anything apart that
might have gotten in his way.
