Before there were any Counts of Mansfeld, a knight by the name of George 
lived in Mansfeld Castle. A lindorm lived on 

a hill outside the city (in the direction of Eisleben), and even today 
this hill is called Lindberg. To save their own 

lives, the inhabitants had to give a maiden to the lindorm every day as a 
tribute. Soon there were no more virgins to 

be found in the little city, and the lindorm demanded the knight's 
daughter. The following morning the knight himself 

challenged the dragon and slew him, freeing the city. Henceforth he was 
called Saint George, instead of George.  
As a memorial the image of him killing the dragon was carved in stone 
above the Mansfeld church entrance, and can be seen even today.
