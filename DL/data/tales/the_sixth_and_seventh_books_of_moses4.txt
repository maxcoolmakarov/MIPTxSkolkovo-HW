Many years ago there lived in Trent an old master tailor whose wife had 
inherited an unusual book from her mother. They say she had the sixth and 
the seventh books of Moses. Whenever the woman read in the book, deer, 
wolves, hares, and other animals would come to her, lie down at her feet, 
and play with her children. All these animals would disappear as soon as 
the book was closed.  
One day while the woman was reading the book, she was surprised by her 
husband. He grabbed the book and threw it into the stove. But behold! The 
fire went out, and the book remained undamaged. The tailor did not want to 
have this book in his house any longer, so, acting on the advice of some 
old people, he had a boy who was born on a Sunday during the sermon throw 
the book into the stove. That worked, for the book was immediately 
consumed by the flames.
