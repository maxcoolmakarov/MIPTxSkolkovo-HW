Merrily, merrily rang the bells,  
The bells o'er Rostherne mere,  
The tale of joy their soft echo tells  
E'en Bowden heights may hear.    

At Rostherne church long, long ago,  
Repairs some workmen make,  
When, as they laboured cheerily oh,  
They felt the tower shake.  

As the tower shook, the largest bell  
Was riven from its place,  
And eke loud clattering down it fell,  
And rolling 'gan apace.  

Down the steep cliff-like bank it rolled   
That frowns above the mere,   
Through the fragrant birch and lindens old,   
At length the lake drew near.  

It stopped at the brink; hard strove the men   
To force it up the crag,   
Back to the tower to strain again   
Oh 'twas a weary drag!   

A sulky labourer madly cried,  
"Oh, would the Devil had you!"  
But scarce he'd spoke when the bell belied  
To the wave downwards flew.  

But first in its headlong course it crushed  
Th' unlucky wight who swore,  
Then down the wild crag madly rushed;  
They never saw it more.  

Sunk in the depths of that mere profound  
To which there's bottom none,  
And as it sank a dull gurgling sound  
Just to the surface won.   

Now sadly, oh! sadly moans the peal,  
And mourns that fatal hour;  
They seem o'er the bell to ring a knell  
That fell from Rostherne tower.
