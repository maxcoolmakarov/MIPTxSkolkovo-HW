About three hundred years ago a pious man by the name of Melchior was the preacher at Veckholm. Every evening, whatever the season or weather, it was his custom to go to the church and pray at the altar.  
His wife could not stand this, so she said to her servant, "Listen, Lorenz, at midnight go to my husband on his way home, and attempt to frighten him."  
He did just that.  He covered himself in a white sheet and appeared before the preacher.   
The preacher stepped up to him and said, "Who are you?" but he received no answer.  
He asked the same question a second time, but now the servant began to sink into the earth, while begging forgiveness for his sacrilege.  
To this the preacher replied, "I cannot save you.  It is too late!"  
And then the servant sank completely beneath the earth.
