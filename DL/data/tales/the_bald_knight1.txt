A certain knight, who wore a wig to conceal his baldness, was out hunting 
one day. A sudden gust of wind carried away 

his wig and showed his bald pate. His friends all laughed heartily at the 
odd figure he made, but the old fellow, so 

far from being put out, laughed as heartily as any of them. "Is it any 
wonder," said he, "that another man's hair 

shouldn't keep on my head when my own wouldn't stay there?"  
 Moral: Every event has its reason.
