A neighbor came running to Nasreddin's house with the news that the 
Hodja's mother-in-law had been washing her laundry in the river when she 
fell into the water and drowned. "And we cannot find her body," he 
continued. "We searched everywhere downstream for her, but all to no 
avail."  
 "You should have searched upstream," replied the Hodja. "My 
mother-in-law is so contrary that she would never go with the flow."
