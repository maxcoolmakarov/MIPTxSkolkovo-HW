In that time two millstones were found in Denmark, so great that no one 
was so strong that he could turn them. The nature of the mill was such 
that whatsoever he who turned asked for, was ground out by the millstones. 
This mill was called Grotti. He who gave King Frodi the mill was named 
Hengikj√∂ptr. King Frodi had the maidservants led to the mill, and 
bade them grind gold; and they did so. First they ground gold and peace 
and happiness for Frodi; then he would grant them rest or sleep no longer 
than the cuckoo held its peace or a song might be sung. It is said that 
they sang the song which is called the Lay of Grotti, and this is its 
beginning: 
 
Now are we come   
To the king's house,     
The two fore-knowing,     
Fenja and Menja:     
These are with Frodi     
Son of Fridleifr,     
The Mighty Maidens,     
As maid-thralls held. 
  
And before they ceased their singing, they ground out a host against 
Frodi, so that the sea king called Mysingr came there that same night and 
slew Frodi, taking much plunder. Then the Peace of Frodi was ended. 
Mysingr took Grotti with him, and Fenja and Menja also, and bade them 
grind salt. And at midnight they asked whether Mysingr were not weary of 
salt. He bade them grind longer. They had ground but a little while, when 
down sank the ship; and from that time there has been a whirlpool in the 
sea where the water falls through the hole in the millstone. It was then 
that the sea became salt.
