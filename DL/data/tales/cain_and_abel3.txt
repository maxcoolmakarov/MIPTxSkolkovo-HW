It is related that when our mother Eve bare Cain and Abel, she bare a
daughter along with each.  God Most High commanded the Messenger Adam,
saying, "For the sake of their offspring, give to Cain the girl born with
Abel, and give to Abel the girl born with Cain."  The Messenger Adam did
so. 
Now the girl born with Cain was exceeding fair; and Cain said, "O father,
let the girl born with him be his, and let the girl born with me be
mine." 
Adam answered, "God Most High commanded otherwise."  But Cain loved that
girl exceedingly; so he went and slew Abel.  Thus because of a woman was
blood first shed upon the ground.
