In Damsdorf many years ago a number of boys were herding cattle in a
field. One Sunday morning Farmer Bruhnke was suddenly overcome by an
uncanny fear, and he rushed out to the field to see what the herders were
doing. He had scarcely left the village when a little man came his way who
asked him where he was going. Bruhnke told him, and the little man replied
that he had just passed the boys, who were passing the time by playing a
game. 
 Bruhnke was relieved, but as he took leave of the little man, he
noticed that the latter had a hen's foot. He ran as fast as his feet would
carry him to the herding place, but it was too late. The head of one of
the herders was already dancing on the ground. 
 The boys had wanted to see how beheading went. To this end they built
themselves an actual guillotine, fastening an old blade from a straw
cutter onto a platform to serve as an ax. They all tried it, but just as
they tied the last one to the block, a three-legged hare came limping by,
and the boys ran after it, completely forgetting their comrade and the
cattle. The prisoner tried to free himself of his bonds, but his motions
released the blade, and the unfortunate boy paid for his game with his
life.
