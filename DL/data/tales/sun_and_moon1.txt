The heavenly bodies were once ordinary Eskimos, living upon the earth, who, for one reason or an other, have been translated to the skies. The sun was a fair woman, and the moon her brother, and they lived in the same house. She was visited every night by a man, but could not tell who it was. In order to find out, she blackened her hands with lamp-soot, and rubbed them upon las back. When the morning came, it turned out to be her brother, for his white reindeer-skin was all smudged; and hence come the spots on the moon.  
The sun seized a crooked knife, cut off one of her breasts, and threw it to him, crying: "Since my whole body tastes so good to you, eat this."  
Then she lighted a piece of lamp-moss and rushed out; the moon did likewise and ran after her, but his moss went out, and that is why he looks like a live cinder. He chased her up into the sky, and there they still are.
