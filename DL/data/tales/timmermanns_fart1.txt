Once a carpenter made a pact with the devil, and when his time was up, the devil came to him and wanted to take him away.  
However, the carpenter told him that he had to fulfill one last request for him, and the devil agreed to this. With that the carpenter broke wind mightily and then told the devil to bring it back to him. The devil was not able to do this, however much he tried.  
A whirlwind is just the devil flying along behind the carpenter's fart. For this reason a whirlwind is called simply "Timmerman's Fart." [ Timmermann  is Low German for  carpenter .]
