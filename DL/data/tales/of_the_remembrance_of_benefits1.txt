There was a knight who devoted much of his time to hunting. It
happened one day, as he was pursuing this diversion, that he was met by a
lame lion, who showed him his foot. The knight dismounted, and drew from
it a sharp thorn; and then applied an unguent to the wound, which speedily
healed it. 
 A while after this, the king of the country hunted in the same wood,
and caught that lion, and held him captive for many years.  
 Now, the knight, having offended the king, fled from his anger to the
very forest in which he had been accustomed to hunt. There he betook
himself to plunder, and spoiled and slew a multitude of travelers. But the
king's sufferance was exhausted; he sent out an army, captured, and
condemned him to be delivered to a fasting lion. The knight was
accordingly thrown into a pit, and remained in terrified expectation of
the hour when he should be devoured. But the lion, considering him
attentively, and remembering his former friend, fawned upon him; and
remained seven days with him destitute of food.  
 When this reached the ears of the king, he was struck with wonder, and
directed the knight to be taken from the pit. "Friend," said he, "by what
means have you been able to render the lion harmless?" 
 "As I once rode along the forest, my lord, that lion met me lame. I
extracted from his foot a large thorn, and afterward healed the wound, and
therefore he has spared me." 
 "Well," returned the king, "since the lion has spared you, I will for
this time ratify your pardon. Study to amend your life." 
 The knight gave thanks to the king, and ever afterwards conducted
himself with all propriety. He lived to a good old age, and ended his days
in peace. 
 
 
 Application: 
 
 My beloved, the knight is the world; the lame lion is the human race;
the thorn, original sin, drawn out by baptism. The pit represents
penitence, whence safety is derived.
