When Count Ludwig of Th√ºringen went with Emperor Friedrich to Palestine, God sent to him from heaven the banner of the knight Saint George, as a reward for his charity and good works. The banner was brought to the Wartburg, and afterwards to the castle Tharand in Meissen. In 1190 fire broke out in the castle, and many people saw the banner fly out of the fire and through a window. However, no one saw what became of the banner. To commemorate this miracle the Saint George Church was later built in Eisenach.
