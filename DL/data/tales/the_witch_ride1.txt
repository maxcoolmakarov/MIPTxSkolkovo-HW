Once there was a wealthy peasant, whose wife -- the people said -- was
a witch. This was repeated so often that the peasant himself finally heard
the rumor. He wanted to get to the bottom of the matter, and thus one day
before May Night he went out and got some turf from the grave of a child
who had died without being baptized. He secretly hid the turf then went to
bed with his wife. He closed his eyes and pretended to be asleep, although
he remained awake and attentive. 
 At the strike of twelve his wife did indeed get up and sneak out the
bedroom door. The peasant, taking turf with him, followed her outside the
house door, where she suddenly disappeared. He saw nothing but a troop of
black horses. But the peasant did not allow himself to be deceived.
Quickly placing the turf on his head, he saw -- instead of the black
horses -- women and girls of his acquaintance. In their midst was his
wife. He also heard them discussing their trip to Block Mountain. He
recognized them, because anyone beneath the earth can see witches and
spirits in their true form. 
 Angered, the peasant jumped at his wife and swung himself onto her,
just as one would climb onto an ordinary horse's back. He also knew
witches' magic words and called out: 
 
 Horse of black, horse so fleet, 
Do you duty with quick feet.
 
 Then she rose up and carried him into the air. She did not tire from
the mighty ride, nor did the peasant grow tired. Again and again he called
out: 
 
 Horse of black, horse so fleet, 
Do you duty with quick feet.
 
 But that was his misfortune, because before he knew it, May Night was
over. Morning broke across the mountains, and his wife was no longer a
black horse. She let out a pitiful scream, and together they fell from
high in the air, horribly smashing themselves to pieces. 
 From that time forth they have made this same ride every night, and
they will have no rest until the day of judgement.
