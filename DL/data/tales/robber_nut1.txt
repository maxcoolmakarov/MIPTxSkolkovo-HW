Once upon a time there lived an old man and an old woman to whom God had given no children.  
They asked about this here and there, and finally someone said to them: "If you want to have children there is no other way but to take a bladder and blow into it for twenty days and twenty nights. If you do so, you will find a child in the bladder."  
They did just that, and after twenty days they found a boy in the bladder. He was just as large as a nut.  
They took him out, dressed him, and fed him, but he did not grow any larger. At the age of fifteen he was still the size of a nut.  
One day they sent him out to the field to plow with the oxen. He jumped onto the front of the plow and steered the oxen.  
Three robbers came by. Thinking that the oxen were unattended (for they didn't see the boy), they began to remove their yoke. The boy hit their hands with his goad. At first they were frightened, but then they paid closer attention and saw him sitting on the plow. They took him with them and went to steal the priest's oxen.  
Arriving at the priest's house they let the boy through a crack in the door, for he was only as large as a nut. Once inside he opened the door for them. They took the oxen and escaped.  
He too became a robber, and no other robber was his equal. He was called Robber Nut, and the whole world was afraid of him.  However, in the end he drowned in a river.
