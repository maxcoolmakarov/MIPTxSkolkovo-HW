There is a lake known as Holy Lake near the village of Neuhoff not far
from the Elbe River in the district of Wolmirstedt. 
 At the time of Burkhard, the twenty-seventh archbishop of Magdeburg,
who served from the year 1295 to the year 1304, this lake was filled with
spirits and ghosts. They often frightened the fishermen and boatsmen, and
caused them much harm, drowning and causing the miserable death of many a
man. When Archbishop Burkhard, a very pious and God-fearing man, heard of
this, he went to the lake with great sincerity, and blessed the place,
driving the evil spirits away, and they have never been seen there
again. 
 From that time until the present day the lake has been known as Holy
Lake.
