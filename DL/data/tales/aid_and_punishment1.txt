On the side of Mount Pilatus is a place name the Kastler-Alp, now covered
with stones and rubble, but which once was verdant and fertile.  The cause
of the change was as follows: 
The land there was formerly occupied by a farmer, a churlish, unfeeling
man, who, though wealthy, let his only sister struggle with the greatest
poverty in the valley beneath.  The poor woman at length having fallen
sick, and seeing no other resource, resolved to apply to her hard-hearted
brother for the means of employing a doctor.  She sent her daughter to
him; but all the prayers and tears of the poor girl failed to move him,
and he told her he would sooner than give her anything, see the Alp
covered with stones and rubble.  She departed, and as she went along, a
dwarf suddenly appeared to her.  She would have fled, but he gently
detained her, and telling her he had heard all that had passed, gave her a
parcel of herbs, which he assured her would cure her mother, and a little
cheese, which he said would last them a long time. 
On trial, the herbs quickly produced the promised effect; and when they
went to cut the cheese they found the knife would not penetrate it, and no
wonder, for it was pure gold. 
There also came a sudden storm on the mountain, and the Kastler-Alp was
reduced to its present condition.
