Once upon a time, as a chicken was pecking under a gooseberry bush, a gooseberry fell on his head.  
"Dear me!" said Chickie Birdie, "the lifts are falling. I wonder if the king knows. I think I'll go and tell him, and perhaps he will give me a reward."  
So away started Chickie Birdie. He had not gone far before he met Henny Penny.  
"Good morning, Chickie Birdie," said she; "and where are you going?"  
"I'm going to tell the king the lifts have fallen."  
"Who told you, Chickie Birdie; who told you?"  
"Who told me! The thing that I both heard and felt! Why it came ripple rapple down on my fore-pen (beak)."  
"I'll go with you, Chickie Birdie."  
So they went on together, and they met Goosey-Poosey, Ducky-Daddles, Cockie-Lockie, and Pow Parley (turkey), with each of whom the same formula is gone through.  
They all went on together, and presently it began to rain, and they took refuge in a washing-house.  
Presently up came Tod Lowrie (fox), and he begged hard to be let in: "Just his fore-paw, because it was getting so wet," then "only just the tip of his nose," "his head," and so on, until he got in altogether.  
Then they all cried out: "Tod Lowrie! Tod Lowrie, the huntsmen and the hounds are coming! Jump in here!"  
So he jumped into the boiler, and Goosey-Poosey poured hot water upon him!  
Then they went on to the king, and Chickie Birdie told him all about the lifts falling, and he thanked them very much and ordered them a good dinner.
