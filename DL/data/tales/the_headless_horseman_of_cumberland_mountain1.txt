A headless horseman rides upon the road near Indian Fort, in the foothills of Cumberland Mountain. His story is unknown, and this phantom's wanderings are apparently objectless. Nevertheless he is ill to meet, for unlike the same kind of an apparition described by Crofton Croker in the south of Ireland, this brings misfortune, and those who have seen it had reason to regret their encounter.
