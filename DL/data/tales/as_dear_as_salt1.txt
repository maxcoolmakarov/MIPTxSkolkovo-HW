A king once asked his daughter how dear he was to her.
 "As dear, as dear -- as salt!" she said.
 The king thought that this was very little, and he was very unhappy
with his child's answer.
 Soon thereafter he sponsored a great feast. The daughter saw to it that
every dish was brought to the table unsalted, and thus nothing tasted good
to the king.
 Finally the daughter explained everything to him. He then recognized
how important salt was, and that his daughter had spoken very positively.
Thus he loved her again as dearly as before.
