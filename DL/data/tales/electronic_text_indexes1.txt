Thousands of books and shorter pieces, many of them relevant to folk and 
fairy-tale studies, are available gratis on the Internet as electronic 
texts. The most comprehensive index of such texts in English is the 
University of Pennsylvania's  Online Books , which 
currently lists over 20,000 titles. It also includes links to numerous 
foreign-language electronic libraries.   
To assist in finding a desired text among their thousands of listed 
titles, Online Books includes a number of search tools. Two hints for 
browsing:
 
 Search for the word  fairy, folk, folktale, folktales, tale,   or 
 tales   in the  title field . 
Note that the search function uses only whole words, so a search for 
 tale   will not find a title with the plural form  tales.   
 Browse in the subject-matter section under the  Library 
of Congress classification GR , folklore.  
 
The Online Books data base is also available through the  World eBook Library , 
which includes links to a large number of reference works (dictionaries, 
multilingual dictionaries, thesauri, encyclopedias), academic libraries 
worldwide, and other research tools.   
The  Digital 
Book Index  combines and integrates the free books listed through 
Online Books with commercial titles available for a fee. The 
subject-matter search tool is very useful. A search under the category 
"folklore, myths, legends, fables" yielded over 100 titles. This site 
requires a sign-on procedure, but its use is without charge.
