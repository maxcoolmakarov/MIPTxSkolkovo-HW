A witch, desirous of injuring a neighbor, changed herself into a black
dog and made her way into the neighbor's ben-end-o'-the-hoose, where she
would certainly have created serious disturbance if an old man in the
family had not recognized her by a peculiar formation of the eyelids,
which, it seems, she could not discard from her canine appearance.
 Seizing the tongs, the worthy patriarch brought them down upon the
black dog's back with might and main. "Tak' doo yon, Minnie Merran (the
witch's name), he cried, "an bear doo da weight o' dis auld airm as lang
as doo leeves."
 The dog ran howling and limping out of the house, and when next the
witch was seen, she who hitherto had walked upright and with the dignity
of a Norna, leant upon a stick, and had a hump upon her back. She said she
had fallen from a height, and was afraid her spine was broken. But folk
called it "the mark o' auld Jockie's taings."
