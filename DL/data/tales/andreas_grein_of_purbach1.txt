During the Turkish wars the wild hordes of riders advanced as far as
Purbach. On such occasions the townspeople of Purbach fled into the nearby
Leitha Mountains to seek refuge there from the hordes. During one such
attack Andreas Grein remained at home. 
 When the Turkish horde found Grein, they placed him in handcuffs, tied
him to a horse's tail, and thus forced him to run along behind. The Turks
took Grein back to their country, where he was housed in a stall and
forced to pull a plow by day. For food he received nuts and millet. 
 After seven years of terrible suffering he succeeded -- with the help
of a fellow countrywoman -- in escaping from Turkey. In October 1647,
after traveling on foot for many months, he arrived at Purbach. He stopped
to rest on his own property, about 1000 steps from the town. He then went
to his home, where he encountered his wife, who had recently remarried.
She did not recognize Grein, because of his wild appearance. After much
discussion she recognized her husband from his voice. She asked him for
forgiveness, and they lived happily together until they died. The second
husband, of course, had to step aside. 
 At the place where he had rested, Grein erected a Holy Trinity column,
inscribed with the year 1647.
