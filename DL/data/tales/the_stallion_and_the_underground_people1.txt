In the vicinity of Neustadt-GÃ¶dens there was a peasant who had a stallion that he had brought in from the marshland for breeding. He put him into the stall.   
One day his wife was alone in the house when suddenly an underground man came forth and said that they could not stand it any longer with the stallion above them.  Its place was right over their quarters, and he was dropping filth onto them in the most disgusting manner. Therefore she should see to it that he be taken away, otherwise bad things would happen to her.  
After saying this, he disappeared.    
In all haste the people moved the stallion to a different stall.
