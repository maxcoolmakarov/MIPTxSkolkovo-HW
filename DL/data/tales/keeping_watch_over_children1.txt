German Legends   
A reliable citizen of Leipzig told the following story:  When his first 
child was a few weeks old they found it on three different nights lying 
crossways and uncovered in its cradle, even though the cradle stood 
immediately next to the mother's bed.  The father therefore resolved to 
stay awake during the third night and to pay close attention to his 
child.  He persisted a long while, staying awake until after midnight.  
Nothing happened to the child, because he had been keeping a watchful eye 
on it.  But then his eyes began to close a little.  Shortly afterward the 
mother woke up and saw that the child was again lying crossways, and that 
the cover had been taken from the cradle and thrown across the middle of 
her bed.  In keeping with common custom, she normally folded the cover 
back at the foot of the cradle.  Everything had happened so fast that 
everyone was amazed.  However, the demon did not seem to have had any 
further power over the child.
