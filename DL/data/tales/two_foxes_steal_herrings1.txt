A man was one day walking along the road with a creel of herrings on
his back, and two foxes saw him, and the one, who was the biggest, said to
the other, "Stop here and follow the man, and I will run round and pretend
that I am dead." 
 So he ran round and stretched himself on the road. The man came on, and
when he saw the fox, he was well pleased to find so fine a beast, and he
picked him up and threw him into the creel, and he walked on. But the fox
threw the herrings out of the creel, and the other followed and picked
them up. And when the creel was empty, the big fox leaped out and ran
away. And that is how they got the herrings.
