In Danzig a child struck his mother. He died soon afterward and took the
curse of this act with him to his grave. As punishment his hand soon
afterward grew out of the grave. A large stone lay on the grave, and his
fingers forced themselves into it. This stone, with traces of the five
fingers, can still be seen the Parish Church in a chapel not far from the
alter.
