Two hundred years ago for a time there was a frightfully large number of 
werewolves in the city of Greifswald.  They were especially prevelant in 
Rokover Street.  From there they attacked anyone who appeared outside of 
their houses after eight o'clock in the evening.  At that time there were 
a lot of venturesome students in Greifswald.  They banded 
together and one night set forth against the monsters.  At first they 
were powerless against them, until finally the students brought together 
all of the silver buttons that they had inherited, and with these they 
killed the werewolves.
