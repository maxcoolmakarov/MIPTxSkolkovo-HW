There were many dwarfs in the vicinity of the town of Bernstein in Pomerania. The people there called them "the underground people." Once one of them for a long time came to a poor shoemaker and helped him with his work, so that the shoemaker was becoming wealthy. The man decided show his thanks, and he had a very nice new jacket made for the dwarf.   
However, the underground people cannot tolerate this, and upon receiving the jacket he immediately went away, saying, "Master, you have paid me in full; now I am finished with the work!"  
And he never returned.
