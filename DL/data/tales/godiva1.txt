I waited for the train at Coventry;  
I hung with grooms and porters on the bridge,  
To watch the three tall spires; and there I shaped  
The city's ancient legend into this: 
 Not only we, the latest seed of Time,  
New men, that in the flying of a wheel  
Cry down the past, not only we, that prate  
Of rights and wrongs, have loved the people well,  
And loathed to see them overtax'd; but she  
Did more, and underwent, and overcame,  
The woman of a thousand summers back,  
Godiva, wife to that grim Earl, who ruled  
In Coventry: for when he laid a tax  
Upon his town, and all the mothers brought  
Their children, clamoring, "If we pay, we starve!"  
She sought her lord, and found him, where he strode  
About the hall, among his dogs, alone,  
His beard a foot before him and his hair  
A yard behind. She told him of their tears,  
And pray'd him, "If they pay this tax, they starve."  
Whereat he stared, replying, half-amazed,  
"You would not let your little finger ache  
For such as these?" -- "But I would die," said she.  
He laugh'd, and swore by Peter and by Paul;  
Then fillip'd at the diamond in her ear;  
"Oh ay, ay, ay, you talk!" -- "Alas!" she said,  
"But prove me what I would not do."  
And from a heart as rough as Esau's hand,  
He answer'd, "Ride you naked thro' the town,  
And I repeal it;" and nodding, as in scorn,  
He parted, with great strides among his dogs.  
 So left alone, the passions of her mind,  
As winds from all the compass shift and blow,  
Made war upon each other for an hour,  
Till pity won. She sent a herald forth,  
And bade him cry, with sound of trumpet, all  
The hard condition; but that she would loose  
The people: therefore, as they loved her well,  
From then till noon no foot should pace the street,  
No eye look down, she passing; but that all  
Should keep within, door shut, and window barr'd.  
 Then fled she to her inmost bower, and there  
Unclasp'd the wedded eagles of her belt,  
The grim Earl's gift; but ever at a breath  
She linger'd, looking like a summer moon  
Half-dipt in cloud: anon she shook her head,  
And shower'd the rippled ringlets to her knee;  
Unclad herself in haste; adown the stair  
Stole on; and, like a creeping sunbeam, slid  
From pillar unto pillar, until she reach'd  
The Gateway, there she found her palfrey trapt  
In purple blazon'd with armorial gold.  
 Then she rode forth, clothed on with chastity:  
The deep air listen'd round her as she rode,  
And all the low wind hardly breathed for fear.  
The little wide-mouth'd heads upon the spout  
Had cunning eyes to see: the barking cur  
Made her cheek flame; her palfrey's foot-fall shot  
Light horrors thro' her pulses; the blind walls  
Were full of chinks and holes; and overhead  
Fantastic gables, crowding, stared: but she  
Not less thro' all bore up, till, last, she saw  
The white-flower'd elder-thicket from the field,  
Gleam thro' the Gothic archway in the wall.  
 Then she rode back, clothed on with chastity;  
And one low churl, compact of thankless earth,  
The fatal byword of all years to come,  
Boring a little auger-hole in fear,  
Peep'd -- but his eyes, before they had their will,  
Were shrivel'd into darkness in his head,  
And dropt before him. So the Powers, who wait  
On noble deeds, cancell'd a sense misused;  
And she, that knew not, pass'd: and all at once,  
With twelve great shocks of sound, the shameless noon  
Was clash'd and hammer'd from a hundred towers,  
One after one: but even then she gain'd  
Her bower; whence reissuing, robed and crown'd,  
To meet her lord, she took the tax away  
And built herself an everlasting name.
