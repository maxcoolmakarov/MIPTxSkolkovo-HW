death 
 "And they lived happily ever after," popular wisdom notwithstanding, is
not the standard ending for European folktales. English fairy tales, it is
true, often end with this formula, but stories from continental Europe
rarely promise their heroes and heroines everlasting life. If their future
life is mentioned at all, it will most likely be with a generality such as
"and they lived happily until they died," or possibly with the absurdly
safe promise that "if they have not died, they are still alive."
Continental European folktales neither promise their leading characters
life without end nor do they treat death as a taboo, to be mentioned only
with euphemisms and with great caution. Death is as much a part of life in
European folktales as are birth, marriage, and parenting. Like these other
events, it can be painless (even fulfilling) or wrought with conflict and
grief. There is probably more folklore emanating from mortals' response to
dying and death than any other human experience. Mythology, religion,
civilization, and science all offer their explanations and their aid to
the dying and to the survivors, and we want more. Folklore too has added
its voice in helping us to cope with the inevitable and ultimately the
unexplainable final chapter. 
 
 Young men may die, old men must die.  
 Seventy years is the span of our life, 
eighty if our strength holds; 
the hurrying years are labor and sorrow, 
so quickly they pass and are forgotten.
