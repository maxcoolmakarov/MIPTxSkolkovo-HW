Once upon a time a man had a shepherd who served him many years faithfully 
and honestly. One day, whilst herding his flock, this shepherd heard a 
hissing sound, coming out of the forest nearby, which he could not account 
for. So he went into the wood in the direction of the noise to try to 
discover the cause. When he approached the place he found that the dry 
grass and leaves were on fire, and on a tree, surrounded by flames, a 
snake was coiled, hissing with terror.   
The shepherd stood wondering how the poor snake could escape, for the wind 
was blowing the flames that way, and soon that tree would be burning like 
the rest.   
Suddenly the snake cried, "O shepherd! for the love of heaven save me from 
this fire!"   
Then the shepherd stretched his staff out over the flames and the snake 
wound itself round the staff and up to his hand, and from his hand it 
crept up his arm, and twined itself about his neck.   
The shepherd trembled with fright, expecting every instant to be stung to 
death, and said, "What an unlucky man I am! Did I rescue you only to be 
destroyed myself?"   
But the snake answered, "Have no fear; only carry me home to my father who 
is the King of the Snakes."   
The shepherd, however, was much too frightened to listen, and said that he 
could not go away and leave his flock alone; but the snake said, "You need 
not be afraid to leave your flock, no evil shall befall them; but make all 
the haste you can."   
So he set off through the wood carrying the snake, and after a time he 
came to a great gateway, made entirely of snakes intertwined one with 
another. The shepherd stood still with surprise, but the snake round his 
neck whistled, and immediately all the arch unwound itself.   
"When we are come to my father's house," said his own snake to him, "he 
will reward you with anything you like to ask -- silver, gold, jewels, or 
whatever on this earth is most precious; but take none of all these 
things, ask rather to understand the language of beasts. He will refuse it 
to you a long time, but in the end he will grant it to you."   
Soon after that they arrived at the house of the King of the Snakes, who 
burst into tears of joy at the sight of his daughter, as he had given her 
up for dead. "Where have you been all this time?" he asked, directly he 
could speak, and she told him that she had been caught in a forest fire, 
and had been rescued from the flames by the shepherd. The King of the 
Snakes, then turning to the shepherd, said to him, "What reward will you 
choose for saving my child?"   
"Make me to know the language of beasts," answered the shepherd, "that is 
all I desire."   
The king replied, "Such knowledge would be of no benefit to you, for if I 
granted it to you and you told any one of it, you would immediately die; 
ask me rather for whatever else you would most like to possess, and it 
shall be yours."   
But the shepherd answered him, "Sir, if you wish to reward me for saving 
your daughter, grant me, I pray you, to know the language of beasts. I 
desire nothing else"; and he turned as if to depart.   
Then the king called him back, saying, "If nothing else will satisfy you, 
open your mouth." The man obeyed, and the king spat into it, and said, 
"Now spit into my mouth." The shepherd did as he was told, then the King 
of the Snakes spat again into the shepherd's mouth. When they had spat 
into each other's mouths three times, the king said, "Now you know the 
language of beasts, go in peace; but, if you value your life, beware lest 
you tell anyone of it, else you will immediately die."   
So the shepherd set out for home, and on his way through the wood he heard 
and understood all that was said by the birds, and by every living 
creature. When he got back to his sheep he found the flock grazing 
peacefully, and as he was very tired he laid himself down by them to rest 
a little.   
Hardly had he done so when two ravens flew down and perched on a tree 
nearby, and began to talk to each other in their own language, "If that 
shepherd only knew that there is a vault full of gold and silver beneath 
where that lamb is lying, what would he not do?"   
When the shepherd heard these words he went straight to his master and 
told him, and the master at once took a wagon, and broke open the door of 
the vault, and they carried off the treasure. But instead of keeping it 
for himself, the master, who was an honorable man, gave it all up to the 
shepherd, saying, "Take it, it is yours. The gods have given it to you." 
  
So the shepherd took the treasure and built himself a house.  He married a 
wife, and they lived in great peace and happiness, and he was acknowledged 
to be the richest man, not only of his native village, but of all the 
countryside. He had flocks of sheep, and cattle, and horses without end, 
as well as beautiful clothes and jewels.   
One day, just before Christmas, he said to his wife, "Prepare everything 
for a great feast, tomorrow we will take things with us to the farm that 
the shepherds there may make merry."   
The wife obeyed, and all was prepared as he desired. Next day they both 
went to the farm, and in the evening the master said to the shepherds, 
"Now come, all of you, eat, drink, and make merry. I will watch the flocks 
myself tonight in your stead." Then he went out to spend the night with 
the flocks.   
When midnight struck the wolves howled and the dogs barked, and the wolves 
spoke in their own tongue, saying, "Shall we come in and work havoc, and 
you too shall eat flesh?"   
And the dogs answered in their tongue, "Come in, and for once we shall 
have enough to eat."   
Now amongst the dogs there was one so old that he had only two teeth left 
in his head, and he spoke to the wolves, saying, "So long as I have my two 
teeth still in my head, I will let no harm be done to my master."   
All this the master heard and understood, and as soon as morning dawned he 
ordered all the dogs to be killed excepting the old dog.  The farm 
servants wondered at this order, and exclaimed, "But surely, sir, that 
would be a pity?"   
The master answered, "Do as I bid you"; and made ready to return home with 
his wife, and they mounted their horses, her steed being a mare. As they 
went on their way, it happened that the husband rode on ahead, while the 
wife was a little way behind.   
The husband's horse, seeing this, neighed, and said to the mare, "Come 
along, make haste; why are you so slow?"   
And the mare answered, "It is very easy for you, you carry only your 
master, who is a thin man, but I carry my mistress, who is so fat that she 
weights as much as three."   
When the husband heard that he looked back and laughed, which the wife 
perceiving, she urged on the mare till she caught up with her husband, and 
asked him why he laughed.   
"For nothing at all," he answered; "just because it came into my head." 
  
She would not be satisfied with this answer, and urged him more and more 
to tell her why he had laughed. But he controlled himself and said, "Let 
me be, wife; what ails you? I do not know myself why I laughed."   
But the more he put her off, the more she tormented him to tell her the 
cause of his laughter. At length he said to her, "Know, then, that if I 
tell it you I shall immediately and surely die." But even this did not 
quiet her; she only besought him the more to tell her.   
Meanwhile they had reached home, and before getting down from his horse 
the man called for a coffin to be brought; and when it was there he placed 
it in front of the house, and said to his wife, "See, I will lay myself 
down in this coffin, and will then tell you why I laughed, for as soon as 
I have told you I shall surely die."   
So he lay down in the coffin, and while he took a last look around him, 
his old dog came out from the farm and sat down by him, and whined.  When 
the master saw this, he called to his wife, "Bring a piece of bread to 
give to the dog."   
The wife brought some bread and threw it to the dog, but he would not look 
at it. Then the farm cock came and pecked at the bread; but the dog said 
to it, "Wretched glutton, you can eat like that when you see that your 
master is dying?"   
The cock answered, "Let him die, if he is so stupid. I have a hundred 
wives, which I call together when I find a grain of corn, and as soon as 
they are there I swallow it myself; should one of them dare to be angry, I 
would give her a lesson with my beak. He has only one wife, and he cannot 
keep her in order."   
As soon as the man understood this, he got up out of the coffin, seized a 
stick, and called his wife into the room, saying, "Come, and I will tell 
you what you so much want to know"; and then he began to beat her with the 
stick, saying with each blow, "It is that, wife, it is that!" And in this 
way he taught her never again to ask why he had laughed.
