There was once a king who had lost a valuable ring. He looked for it
everywhere, but could not find it. So he issued a proclamation that if any
astrologer could tell him where it was he would be richly rewarded. 
 A poor peasant by the name of Crab heard of the proclamation. He could
neither read nor write, but took it into his head that he wanted to be the
astrologer to find the king's ring. So he went and presented himself to
the king, to whom he said, "Your majesty must know that I am an
astrologer, although you see me so poorly dressed. I know that you have
lost a ring and I will try by study to find out where it is." 
 "Very well," said the king, "and when you have found it, what reward
must I give you?" 
 "That is at your discretion, your majesty." 
 "Go, then, study, and we shall see what kind of an astrologer you turn
out to be." 
 He was conducted to a room, in which he was to be shut up to study. It
contained only a bed and a table on which were a large book and writing
materials. Crab seated himself at the table and did nothing but turn over
the leaves of the book and scribble the paper so that the servants who
brought him his food thought him a great man. They were the ones who had
stolen the ring, and from the severe glances that the peasant cast at them
whenever they entered, they began to fear that they would be found out.
They made him endless bows and never opened their mouths without calling
him "Mr. Astrologer." 
 Crab, who, although illiterate, was, as a peasant, cunning, all at once
imagined that the servants must know about the ring, and this is the way
his suspicions were confirmed. He had been shut up in his room turning
over his big book and scribbling his paper for a month, when his wife came
to visit him. He said to her, "Hide yourself under the bed, and when a
servant enters, say, 'That is one.' When another comes, say, 'That is
two,' and so on." 
 The woman hid herself. The servants came with the dinner, and hardly
had the first on entered when a voice from under the bed said, "That is
one." The second one entered; the voice said, "That is two," and so
on. 
 The servants were frightened at hearing that voice, for they did not
know where it came from, and held a consultation. One of them said, "We
are discovered. If the astrologer denounces us to the king as thieves, we
are lost." 
 "Do you know what we must do?" said another. 
 "Let us hear." 
 "We must go to the astrologer and tell him frankly that we stole the
ring, and ask him not to betray us, and present him with a purse of money.
Are you willing?" 
 "Perfectly." 
 So they went in harmony to the astrologer, and making him a lower bow
than usual, one of them began, "Mr. Astrologer, you have discovered that
we stole the ring. We are poor people and if you reveal it to the king, we
are undone. So we beg you not to betray us, and accept this purse of
money." 
 Crab took the purse and then added, "I will not betray you, but you
must do what I tell you, if you wish to save your lives. Take the ring and
make that turkey in the courtyard swallow it, and leave the rest to
me." 
 The servants were satisfied to do so and departed with a low bow. The
next day Crab went to the king and said to him, "Your majesty must know
that after having toiled over a month I have succeeded in discovering
where the ring has gone to." 
 "Where is it, then?" asked the king. 
 "A turkey has swallowed it." 
 "A turkey? Very well, let us see." 
 They went for the turkey, opened it, and found the ring inside. The
king, amazed, presented the astrologer with a large purse of money and
invited him to a banquet. Among the other dishes, there was brought on the
table a plate of crabs. Crabs must then have been very rare, because only
the king and a few others knew their name. Turning to the peasant the king
said, "You, who are an astrologer, must be able to tell me the name of
these things which are in this dish." 
 The poor astrologer was very much puzzled, and, as if speaking to
himself, but in such a way that the others heard him, he muttered, "Ah!
Crab, Crab, what a plight you are in!" All who did not know that his name
was Crab rose and proclaimed him the greatest astrologer in the world.
