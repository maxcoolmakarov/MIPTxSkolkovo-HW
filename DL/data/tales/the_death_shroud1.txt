Every midnight a dead person appeared in the old graveyard in Gross-Woltersdorf.  He would lay his shroud at the gate to the graveyard and then wander about frightening the villagers. A servant once said to his companions that he would take the shroud away from the wandering dead man. They warned him against taking such a risk, but he did it nonetheless.  
The dead man suddenly appeared and demanded his shroud. The servant escaped into the church and barred the door. The dead man whined and pled for his shroud, but did not receive it. Finally he asked the servant to at least stick a corner of it through the keyhole, so that he could tear off a piece.  
The servant did this, and the door flew open with a thunder-like crash.  
The servant was found inside the church, almost dead.  He became sick and suffered an early death.
