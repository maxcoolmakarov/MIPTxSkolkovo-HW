Five journeymen once left a particular place to travel together, and
they promised one another that they would all stay together. After walking
a good distance, one of them suddenly wondered if they were still all
there, and so he asked his comrades. They all stood still, and one of them
began counting, "Here am I, one, two, three, four!" 
 "Gracious! How concerned they were when one of them turned up missing!"
One after the other each one counted, and the result was always four,
because everyone missed himself. 
 Then a stranger came by and asked what the trouble was. They told him
and asked if he could help. The man told them all to press their noses
into the mud and then count the holes. This they did, and when they saw
that five noses were there, they knew that they had not lost one of their
comrades, and they happily continued their journey.
