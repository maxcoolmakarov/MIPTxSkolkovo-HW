Cüstrinichen 
 Legend Book of the Prussian State 
 
In the year 1565 in the village of Cüstrinichen in the New Mark 
Brandenburg, the wife of a peasant named of Andreas Prawitz gave birth to 
a child who was baptized with the name Matthias.  The child originally 
appeared to be perfectly normal, but by the time it had reached the age 
of twenty it still lacked all reason, and had developed a repulsive 
appearance.  And even though it reached the legal age of majority and had 
a beard upon its chin, it never learned to stand or to walk or even to 
speak.  When it was hungry it just whimpered or bellowed.  It could not 
move from one place to the next, and did nothing but eat and drink.  Many 
people thought that it must be a killcrop or a changeling, of the kind 
that Luther discusses in his works.
