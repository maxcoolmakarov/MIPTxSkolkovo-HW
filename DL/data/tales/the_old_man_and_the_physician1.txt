The Masnavi 
An old man complained to his physician that he suffered from headache.  
The physician replied, "That is caused by old age."  
The old man next complained of a defect in his sight, and the physician again told him that his malady was due to old age.  
The old man went on to say that he suffered from pain in the back, from dyspepsia, from shortness of breath, from nervous debility, from inability to walk, and so on; and the physician replied that each of these ailments was likewise caused by old age.  
The old man, losing patience, said, "Fool, know you not that God has ordained a remedy for every malady?"  
The physician answered, "This passion and choler are also symptoms of old age. Since all your members are weak, you have lost the power of self-control, and fly into a passion at every word.''
