There was once a man that worked in the fields, and had a wife, and a 
son, 

and a daughter. One day he caught a hare, and took it home to his wife, 
and 

asked her to make it ready for his dinner. While it was on the fire the 

goodwife tasted and tasted at it, till she had tasted it all away, and she 
did 

not know what to do for her goodman's dinner. 
 So she called her son Johnny to come in and get his head combed, and 
when 

she was combing his head, she killed him and put him into the pot. 
 Well, the goodman came home to his dinner, and his wife set down 
Johnny, 

well boiled, in front of him. And when he was eating, he took up a foot 
and 

said, "That's surely my Johnny's foot." 
 "Such nonsense! It's one of the hare's," said the goodwife. 
 Then he took up a hand and said, "That's surely my Johnny's hand." 
 "You're talking foolishness, goodman. It's another of the hare's 
feet. 
 So when the goodman had eaten his dinner, little Katy, Johnny's sister, 

gather all the bones and buried them beneath a stone just outside the 
door: 
 Where they grew, and they grew, 
To a milk-white doo [dove], 
That took its wings, 
And away it flew. 
 And it flew till it came to where two women were washing 
clothes, and 

it sat down on a stone and cried: 
 Pew, pew, 
My minny me slew, 
My daddy me chew, 
My sister gathered by banes, 
And put them between twa milk-white stanes; 
And I grew, and I grew, 
To a milk-white doo, 
And I took to my wings, and away I flew. 
 "Say that over again, my bonny bird, and we'll give you all 
these 

clothes," said the women. 
 Pew, pew, 
My minny me slew, 
My daddy me chew, 
My sister gathered by banes, 
And put them between twa milk-white stanes; 
And I grew, and I grew, 
To a milk-white doo, 
And I took to my wings, and away I flew. 
 And it got the clothes; and then flew till it came to a man 
counting 

a great heap of silver, and it sat down and cried: 
 Pew, pew, 
My minny me slew, 
My daddy me chew, 
My sister gathered by banes, 
And put them between twa milk-white stanes; 
And I grew, and I grew, 
To a milk-white doo, 
And I took to my wings, and away I flew. 
 Say that again, my bonny bird, and I'll give you all this 
silver," 

said the man. 
 Pew, pew, 
My minny me slew, 
My daddy me chew, 
My sister gathered by banes, 
And put them between twa milk-white stanes; 
And I grew, and I grew, 
To a milk-white doo, 
And I took to my wings, and away I flew. 
 And it got all the silver, and then it flew till it came to two 

millers grinding corn, and it cried: 
 Pew, pew, 
My minny me slew, 
My daddy me chew, 
My sister gathered by banes, 
And put them between twa milk-white stanes; 
And I grew, and I grew, 
To a milk-white doo, 
And I took to my wings, and away I flew. 
 Say that again, my bonny bird, and I'll give you this millstone, 
said 

the miller. 
 Pew, pew, 
My minny me slew, 
My daddy me chew, 
My sister gathered by banes, 
And put them between twa milk-white stanes; 
And I grew, and I grew, 
To a milk-white doo, 
And I took to my wings, and away I flew. 
 And it got the millstone. And then it flew till it lit on its 

father's housetop. It threw small stones down the chimney, and Katy came 
out to 

see what was the matter, and the dove threw all the clothes to her. Then 
the 

father came out, and the dove threw all the silver to him. And then the 
mother 

came out, and the dove threw down the millstone upon her and killed 
her. 
 And at last it flew away, and the goodman and his daughter after 
that, 
 Lived happy, and died happy, 
And never drank out of a dry cappy.
