The mother ot a youth of the Beni-Jennad clan gave him a hundred reals to buy a mule; so he went to market, and on his way met a man carrying a watermelon for sale.  
"How much for the melon?" he asks.  
"What will you give?" says the man.  
"I have only got a hundred reals," answered the booby; "had I more, you should have it"  
"Well," rejoined the man, "I'll take them."  
Then the youth took the melon and handed over the money. "But tell me," says he, "will its young one be as green as it is?"  
"Doubtless," answered the man," it will be green."  
As the booby was going home, he allowed the melon to roll down a slope before him. It burst on its way, when up started a frightened hare.  
"Go to my house, young one," he shouted. "Surely a green animal has come out of it."  
And when he got home, he inquired of his mother if the young one had arrived.
