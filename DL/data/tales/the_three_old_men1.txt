There are people still living today in the Duchy of Schleswig, in the
region of the Angles, who remember the following story. They heard it from
the mouth of Pastor Oest, who died some time ago and who is known for
several scholarly works. However, it is not known if he himself
experienced the events, or if it was a neighboring preacher. 
 In the middle of the eighteenth century it happened that a new preacher
was riding around the boundaries of his diocese in order to familiarize
himself thoroughly with its circumstances. In a remote area there was a
lonely farmstead, and the road led directly past the front yard of the
farmhouse. An old man with snow-white hair was sitting there on a bench
and crying bitterly. The pastor wished him a good evening and asked him
what was wrong with him. 
 "Oh," answered the old man, "my father gave me a beating." 
 Surprised, the preacher tied up his horse and entered the house. He was
met in the entryway by an old man even more aged than the first one. He
was openly agitated and making angry gestures. The preacher addressed him
kindly and asked him the cause of his anger. 
 The old man spoke, "Oh, the boy dropped my father!" 
 With that he opened the parlor door. The pastor was struck with silence
and astonishment when he saw there an old man, bent over with age but
still energetic, sitting in an easy chair next to the stove.
