Once on a time, long ago, there lived at Treva, a hamlet in Zennor, a
wonderful old lady deeply skilled in necromancy.  Her charms, spells, and
dark incantations made her the terror of the neighborhood.  However, this
old lady failed to impress her husband with any belief in her supernatural
powers, nor did he fail to proclaim his unbelief aloud. 
One day this skeptic came home to dinner, and found, being exceedingly
hungry, to his bitter disappointment, that not only was there no dinner to
eat, but that there was no meat in the house.  His rage was great, but all
he could get from his wife was, "I couldn't get meat out of the stones,
could I?"  It was in vain to give the reins to passion, the old woman told
him, and he must know "that hard words buttered no parsnips." 
Well, at length he resolved to put his wife's powers to the proof, and he
quietly but determinedly told her that he would be the death of her if she
did not get him some dinner; but if in half an hour she gave him some good
cooked meat, he would believe all she had boasted of her power, and be
submissive to her forever. 
St. Ives, the nearest market town, was five miles off; but nothing
doubting, the witch put on her bonnet and cloak, and started.  Her husband
watched her from their cottage door, down the hill; and at the bottom of
the hill, he saw his wife quietly place herself on the ground and
disappear.  In her place a fine hare ran on at its full speed. 
He was not a little startled, but he waited, and within the half hour in
walked his wife with "good flesh and taties all ready for aiting."  There
was no longer any doubt, and the poor husband lived in fear of the witch
of Treva to the day of her death. 
This event took place after a few years, and it is said the room was full
of evil spirits, and that the old woman's shrieks were awful to hear.
Howbeit, peace in the shape of pale-faced death came to her at last, and
then a black cloud rested over the house when all the heavens were clear
and blue. 
She was borne to the grave by six aged men, carried, as is the custom,
underhand.  When they were about half way between the house and the
church, a hare started from the roadside and leaped over the coffin.  The
terrified bearers let the corpse fall to the ground, and ran away.
Another lot of men took up the coffin and proceeded. 
They had not gone far when puss was suddenly seen seated on the coffin,
and again the coffin was abandoned.  After long consultation, and being
persuaded by the parson to carry the old woman very quickly into the
churchyard, while he walked before, six others made the attempt, and as
the parson never ceased to repeat the Lord's Prayer, all went on
quietly. 
Arrived at the church stile, they rested the corpse, the parson paused to
commence the ordinary burial service, and there stood the hare, which, as
soon as the clergyman began "I am the resurrection and the life," uttered
a diabolical howl, changed into a black, unshapen creature, and
disappeared.
