An old mother came to visit her daughter. The daughter saw her coming and picked up a roasted chichen that she and her husband were about to eat. Covering it with a platter she hid the chicken in another room.  
The mother sat for a while and then returned to her own home. She had scarcely left when the daughter and her husband carried the chicken back to their table. But when they looked beneath the cover, it was a turtle.  
Thus the turtle, like the chicken between two platters, has a hard shell below and one above.
