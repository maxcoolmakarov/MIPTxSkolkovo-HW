Once upon a time there was a cruel father and he had two little children, a boy and a girl. He led them into a large wood. They walked through the wood for a while, and the father asked the children if they were feeling hungry, and they said they were.  
The father said he would go and get something for them to eat. He went away, and never returned, and the children wandered through the wood, and after a while died with starvation. It is said that the robins brought leaves and covered their dead bodies.
