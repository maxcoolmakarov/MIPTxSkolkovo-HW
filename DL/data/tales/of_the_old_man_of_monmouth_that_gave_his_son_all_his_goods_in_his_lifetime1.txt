In Monmouth dwelt an ancient man, of fair possessions and great lands, having but one son to enjoy all his substance. His son being married, he gave him all that he had, and so would live free from all worldly matters, in his old age, with his son in his own house.   
After the deed of gift was made, awhile the old man sat at the upper end of the table; afterwards, they set him lower, about the middle of the table; next, at the table's end; and then, among the servants; and, last of all, they made him a couch behind the door and covered him with old sackcloth, where, with grief and sorrow, the old man died.   
When the old man was buried, the young man's eldest child said unto him, "I pray you, father, give me this old sackcloth."   
"What wouldst thou do with it?" said his father.   
"Forsooth," said the boy, "it shall serve to cover you, as it did my old grandfather."
