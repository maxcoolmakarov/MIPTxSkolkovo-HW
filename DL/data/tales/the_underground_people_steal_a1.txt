Child 
 
 Legends, Tales, and Customs from Mecklenburg  
According to an old woman from Witzin, in her village and in the entire 
district of Sternberg, it was formerly the practice to keep a light 
burning all night in the vicinity of a newborn child until it was 
baptized.  A certain woman who failed to do this had her child stolen by 
the underground people, and they laid one of their own in its place.
 
The woman noticed the exchange the next day and asked her neighbor for 
advice.  She told her that she should "brew through an egg."  The mother 
followed this advice, and the changeling, who until now had not uttered a 
sound, cried out:
 
 
I am as old  
As Bohemian gold,  
But I have never seen such brewing.
 
 
At this the woman cried out: "To the devil with you!  You are not my 
child!"  Then there was a great commotion, and the changeling 
disappeared, and the mother got back her own child.
