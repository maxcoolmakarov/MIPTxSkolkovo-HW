River 
 
 German Legends  
From time to time nixies would emerge from the Saal River and go into the 
city of Saalfeld where they would buy fish at the market.  They could be 
recognized by their large, dreadful eyes and by the hems of their skirts 
that were always dripping wet.  It is said that they were mortals who, as 
children, had been taken away by nixies, who had then left changelings in 
their place.
