It is curious that the symbol of the plague should be the same both in Slavonic and Celtic lands, the tall gaunt woman in her long white dress. I remember some twelve years ago a Cornish mining village being quite disturbed by the story of a tall woman in white having been seen on the moors, and prophesying to some miners that a pestilence was coming. Fortunately it remained a mere apparition, the prophesy not being fulfilled.  
In the Polish tale of the plague the pestilence appears personified also as a tall woman in white garments, with her hair floating about her, and is hunted by dogs.  
In another Polish variant of the same myth, the plague fixes on the back of a poor peasant whom she compels to carry her like the old man in Sinbad the Sailor, and forces the wretched fellow to carry her about from place to place. He bears with many a sight of misery which she works. At last he beholds his native village. He will not carry the plague there, but drowns himself in the Pruth.  
This evidently is a myth of the carrying of the seeds of infection. Many may carry the infection to others even without catching the disease themselves.
