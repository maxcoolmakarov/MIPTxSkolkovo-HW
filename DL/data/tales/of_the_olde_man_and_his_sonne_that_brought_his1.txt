Asse to the Towne to Sylle  
  
An olde man on a tyme, and a lyttell boye his sonne droue a litel asse 
before them, whiche he purposed to sylle at the markette towne that they 
went to. And bicause he so dyd, the folkes that wrought by the way syde, 
blamed hym. wherfore he set vp his sonne, and went hym selfe on fote. 
Other that sawe that, called hym foole, by cause he lette the yonge boye 
ryde, and he beynge so aged to goo a foote. Than he toke downe the boye, 
and lepte vp, and rode hym selfe. whanne he hadde rydden a lyttell waye, 
he harde other that blamed hym, bycause he made the lyttell yonge boye 
ronne after as a seruaunte, and he his father to ryde. Than he sette vppe 
the boye behynde hym, and so rode forthe.    
Anone he mette with other, that asked hym if the asse were his owne: By 
whiche wordes he coniected, that he did nat wel so to ouercharge the 
lyttell sely asse, that vnethe was able to b'eare one. Thus he troubled 
with their dyuers and manyfolde opinions: whiche neither with his asse 
vacant, nor he alone, nor his sonne alone, nor bothe to gether rydyng at 
ones on the asse, coulde passe forth with out detraction and blame: 
wherfore at last he bounde the asse feet to gether, and put through a 
staffe, and so he and his sonne began to beare the asse betwene them on 
their shulders to the towne. The nouelte of whiche syght caused euery body 
to laughe and blame the folysshenes of them both. The sely olde man was so 
sore agreued, that as he sat and rested hym on a ryuers syde, he threwe 
his asse in to the water. And so whan he had drowned his asse, he tourned 
home agayne. Thus the good man desyrynge to please euerye bodye, 
contentynge none at all, loste his asse.   
By this tale appereth playnelye, that they whiqhe commyt them selfe to the 
opinion of the common people, ben oppressed with great myserye and 
seruage: For how is it possible to please all, whan euery man hath a 
dyuers opinion, and dyuerslye iudgeth? And that was well knowen to the 
poet, whan he sayde,   
 Scinditur incertum studia in contraria vulgus.     
And as Cicero, Persius, and Flaccus say: As many men so many myndes: as 
many heedes so many wyttes. That, that pleaseth one, displeaseth an other: 
Fewe alowe that that they loue nat: and that that a man aloweth, he 
thynketh good. Therfore the beste is, that euery man lyue well, as a good 
Christen man shulde, and care nat for the vayne wordes, and ianglynge of 
the people. For bablynge (as Plutarchus sayth) is a greuous disease, and 
hard to be remedied. For that that shulde heale it (which is wordes of 
wisdome) cureth them that harkneth there vnto: but pratlers wille here 
none but them selfe.
