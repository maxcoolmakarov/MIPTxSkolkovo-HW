Castle Rushen has long been famous for its subterranean passages, and
there are individuals amongst the islanders who still firmly believe that
they lead to a beautiful country underground, inhabited by giants.
Amongst the many tales they relate is one, that, several attempts being
made to explore the passages, which in general proved unsuccessful, a
number of daring fellows agreed to attempt the enterprise in company.
Having armed themselves with staves, etc., etc., and procuring torches,
they descended.  After proceeding a little way, they found an old man, of
great size, with a long beard, and blind, sitting on a rock as if fixed
there.  He, hearing them approach, enquired of them as to the state of the
island, and at last asked one to put forth his hand, on which one of them
gave him a plowshare which he had, when the old giant squeezed the iron
together with the greatest ease, explaining at the same time:  "Then there
are yet men in the Isle of Man."
