Jupiter held a baby show, open to all animals, and a monkey entered her hideous cub for a prize, but Jupiter only laughed at her.
 
"It is all very well," said the monkey, "to laugh at my offspring, but you go into any gallery of antique sculpture and look at the statues and busts of the fellows that you begot yourself."
 
"Sh! don't expose me," said Jupiter, and awarded her the first prize.
