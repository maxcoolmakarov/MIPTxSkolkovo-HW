Once there lived in Baghdad a wealthy man who lost all his means and was 
thus forced to earn his living by hard labor.  One night a man came to 
him in a dream, saying, "Your fortune is in Cairo; go there and seek 
it."  So he set out for Cairo.  He arrived there after dark and took 
shelter for the night in a mosque.  As Allah would have it, a band of 
thieves entered the mosque in order to break into an adjoining house.  
The noise awakened the owners, who called for help.  The Chief of Police 
and his men came to their aid.  The robbers escaped, but when the police 
entered the mosque they found the man from Baghdad asleep there.  They 
laid hold of him and beat him with palm rods until he was nearly dead, 
then threw him into jail. 
Three days later the Chief of Police sent for him and asked, "Where do 
you come from?" 
"From Baghdad," he answered. 
"And what brought you to Cairo?" 
"A man came to me in a dream and told me to come to Cairo to find my 
fortune," answered the man from Baghdad  "But when I came here, the 
promised fortune proved to be the palm rods you so generously gave to me." 
"You fool," said the Chief of Police, laughing until his wisdom teeth 
showed.  "A man has come to me three times in a dream and has described a 
house in Baghdad where a great sum of money is supposedly buried beneath 
a fountain in the garden.  He told me to go there and take it, but I 
stayed here.  You, however, have foolishly journeyed from place to place 
on the faith of a dream which was nothing more than a meaningless 
hallucination."  He then gave him some money saying, "This will help you 
return to your own country." 
The man took the money.  He realized that the Chief of Police had just 
described his own house in Baghdad, so he forthwith returned home, where 
he discovered a great treasure beneath the fountain in his garden.  Thus 
Allah gave him abundant fortune and brought the dream's prediction to 
fulfillment.
