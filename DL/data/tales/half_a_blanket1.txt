In France an old king, weak with age, gave his kingdom and all his
lands to his son, who in return promised to personally care for him. Soon
afterward the son took himself a wife, who did not like the father. 
 Spitefully she said, "The old man is always coughing at the table until
it takes away all my pleasure in eating." 
 So to please her, the son gave his father a place to lie beneath the
stairs. For many years he lay there on a bed of hay and straw like one
they would make for the dogs. 
 The queen gave birth to a son, who grew into a proud and virtuous lad.
Recognizing the situation, he brought whatever food and drink he could
find to his grandfather. One day the grandfather asked for an old horse
blanket to protect him from the cold, and the virtuous youth ran off to
fulfill his wish. 
 In the stall he found a good horse blanket. He took it from the horse
and ripped it in two. Seeing him, his father asked him what he was doing
with the horse blanket. 
 "I am taking half of it for your father's bed," he said. "The other
half I'll save for you when you are sleeping there where you now have your
father locked in."
