Once upon a time there was a prince who wanted to find a princess, but
she would have to be a  real  princess. So he traveled all around the
world to find one, but there was always something wrong. There were
princesses enough, but he could never be sure that they were real ones.
There was always something about them that was not quite right. So he came
home again and was sad, for he so much wanted to have a real princess. 
 One evening there was a terrible storm. It thundered and lightninged!
The rain poured down! It was horrible! Then there was a knock at the city
gate, and the old king went out to open it. 
 A princess was standing outside. But my goodness, how she looked from
the rain and the weather! Water ran down from her hair and her clothes. It
ran into the toes of her shoes and out at the heels. And yet she said that
she was a real princess. 
 "Well, we shall soon find that out," thought the old queen. But she
said nothing, went into the bedroom, took off all the bedding and laid a
pea on the bottom of the bed. Then she took twenty mattresses and laid
them on the pea, and then twenty featherbeds of eiderdown on top of the
mattresses. 
 That was where the princess was to sleep for the night. In the morning
she was asked how she had slept. 
 "Oh, horribly!" she said. "I hardly closed my eyes all night. Goodness
knows what there was in the bed! I was lying on something hard, so that I
am black and blue all over my body. It is horrible!" 
 Now they could see that she was a real princess, because she had felt
the pea right through the twenty mattresses and the twenty featherbeds.
Nobody but a real princess could be that sensitive. 
 So the prince took her for his wife, because now he knew that he had a
real princess. And the pea was put in the art gallery where it can still
be seen, unless someone has taken it. 
 Now see, that was a real story!
