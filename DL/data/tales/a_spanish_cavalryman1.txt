On earth people have to die; otherwise there would not be enough room for the young ones. It is no wonder then that once a little tailor got sick and died.   
So the tailor died, and just like a needle pulling a thread, his soul went straight toward heaven. He found the door and knocked ever so politely. After he had knocked a while the window opened, and Saint Peter asked who was there.   
The needle-hero said, "Hey, it is little tailor, who -- with permission -- would like to enter heaven, Mr. Peter."   
"A little tailor?" said the latter. "An ironing-board finch? We can't use the likes of you in heaven." And with that Peter shut the window.   
While the tailor was standing there just outside of heaven, sorrowing and complaining, he saw an old woman who had also been told that they could not use her in heaven. The two comforted one another while seated outside there in the darkness. Meanwhile a mighty hussar approached and called out that he would like admission to heaven. Saint Peter did not make him wait long, because the latter had told someone that he was a Spanish cavalryman.   
The little tailor took note of this, quickly ran over to the little old woman, and said to her, "How would it be, my friend, if the two of us were to smuggle ourselves into heaven? Not a bad idea, I believe. Quick now, little woman, I have a clever plan. I will be a Spanish cavalryman, and you will carry me up to heaven's door. I'll take care of the rest. The important thing is that we will both get into heaven!"   
No sooner said than done. The needle-knight climbed onto the little woman just outside of Saint Peter's gate.   
"Who is there?" the person with the keycalled out from inside.   
"A Spanish cavalryman!" shouted the little tailor with all his might.   
The door opened, and our Spanish knight proudly rode in and took his place with the other people in heaven.  
  
So that is what the tailor did,   
And everyone laughed at him,   
And had a good time all around,   
And they never had to leave again.
