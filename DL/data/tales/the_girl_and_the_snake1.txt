Once upon a time there was a girl who was supposed to go into the woods
and bring home the cattle, but she could not find the herd. She got lost
and came to a large mountain with gates and doors. She went inside. A
table was standing there, set with all kinds of things to eat. There was
also a bed there, and a large snake was lying on it.   
It said to the girl,
"Have a seat, if you want to. Come and lie down in this bed, if you want
to! But if you don't want to, it's all right!"   
The girl did not do any of
this.   
Finally the snake said, "People are coming now who want to dance
with you, but don't go with them."   
Soon afterward people did come, and
they wanted to dance with the girl, but she would have nothing to do with
them. Then they began to eat and drink. The girl left the mountain and
went home again. The next day she went into the woods again to look for
her herd, but she could not find what she was looking for. Instead, she
got lost again and came to the same mountain. She went inside again and
found everything the same as the first time: a set table and the bed with
the snake.   
It said to her, as the time before, "Have a seat, if you want
to! Eat, if you want to! Come and lie down in this bed, if you want to!
But if you don't want to, it's all right. Now a lot more people are coming
who want to dance with you, but do not go with them."   
The snake had barely
finished talking when a lot more people came, and they began to dance and
to eat and drink. The girl had nothing to do with them, but instead left
the mountain and went home. 
 On the third day she went into the woods again, and the same thing
happened to her as on the previous days. The snake invited her to eat and
drink, which she did with a good appetite. After that the snake asked her
to lie down next to it, and the girl did that as well.   
Then the snake
said, "Hold me in your arm!"   
She did it.   
"Kiss me!" said the snake. "If
you are afraid, just put your apron between us!"   
The girl did it, and in
that instant the snake turned into a handsome young man. In reality he was
a prince who had been bewitched into this form through magic, but the
girl's courage had saved him. Of course, the two of them went away, and
since then they have never been heard from again.
