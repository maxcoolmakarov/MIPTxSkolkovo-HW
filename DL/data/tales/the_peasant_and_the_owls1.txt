If one goes through the woods at nighttime calling out, "Owl, owl, come along, come along!" the owls will come and peck out one's eyes.  
One night a peasant was walking through the woods, and he thought, "I want to see if what they say about the owls is true."  
So he called out, and behold, the owls came flying by from all sides and pecked away at him. The next morning he still had his eyesight, but he was found in the woods badly pecked and covered with blood.
