Stories of fairies appearing in the shape of cats are common in the
North of England. Mr. Longstaffe relates that a farmer of Staindrop, in
Durham, was one night crossing a bridge, when a cat jumped out, stood
before him, and looking him full in the face, said: 
 Johnny Reed! Johnny Reed! 
Tell Madam Momfort 
That Mally Dixon's dead. 
 The farmer returned home, and in mickle wonder recited this awfu'
stanza to his wife, when up started their black cat, saying, "Is she?" and
disappeared for ever. It was supposed she was a fairy in disguise, who
thus went to attend a sister's funeral, for in the North fairies do die,
and green shady spots are pointed out by the country folks as the
cemeteries of the tiny people.
