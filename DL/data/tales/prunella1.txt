There was once upon a time a woman who had an only daughter. When the 
child was about seven years old she used to pass every day, on her way to 
school, an orchard where there was a wild plum tree, with delicious ripe 
plums hanging from the branches. Each morning the child would pick one, 
and put it into her pocket to eat at school. For this reason she was 
called Prunella.   
Now, the orchard belonged to a witch. One day the witch noticed the child 
gathering a plum, as she passed along the road. Prunella did it quite 
innocently, not knowing that she was doing wrong in taking the fruit that 
hung close to the roadside. But the witch was furious, and next day hid 
herself behind the hedge, and when Prunella came past, and put out her 
hand to pluck the fruit, she jumped out and seized her by the arm.   
"Ah! you little thief!" she exclaimed. "I have caught you at last. Now you 
will have to pay for your misdeeds."   
The poor child, half dead with fright, implored the old woman to forgive 
her, assuring her that she did not know she had done wrong, and promising 
never to do it again. But the witch had no pity, and she dragged Prunella 
into her house, where she kept her till the time should come when she 
could have her revenge.   
As the years passed Prunella grew up into a very beautiful girl. Now her 
beauty and goodness, instead of softening the witch's heart, aroused her 
hatred and jealousy.   
One day she called Prunella to her, and said, "Take this basket, go to the 
well, and bring it back to me filled with water. If you don't I will kill 
you."   
The girl took the basket, went and let it down into the well again and 
again. But her work was lost labor. Each time, as she drew up the basket, 
the water streamed out of it. At last, in despair, she gave it up, and 
leaning against the well she began to cry bitterly, when suddenly she 
heard a voice at her side saying, "Prunella, why are you crying?"   
Turning round she beheld a handsome youth, who looked kindly at her, as if 
he were sorry for her trouble.   
"Who are you," she asked, "and how do you know my name?"   
"I am the son of the witch," he replied, "and my name is Bensiabel. I know 
that she is determined that you shall die, but I promise you that she 
shall not carry out her wicked plan. Will you give me a kiss, if I fill 
your basket?"   
"No," said Prunella, "I will not give you a kiss, because you are the son 
of a witch."   
"Very well," replied the youth sadly. "Give me your basket and I will fill 
it for you." And he dipped it into the well, and the water stayed in it. 
Then the girl returned to the house, carrying the basket filled with 
water.   
When the witch saw it, she became white with rage, and exclaimed, 
"Bensiabel must have helped you." And Prunella looked down, and said 
nothing.   
"Well, we shall see who will win in the end," said the witch, in a great 
rage. The following day she called the girl to her and said, "Take this 
sack of wheat. I am going out for a little; by the time I return I shall 
expect you to have made it into bread. If you have not done it I will kill 
you." Having said this she left the room, closing and locking the door 
behind her.   
Poor Prunella did not know what to do. It was impossible for her to grind 
the wheat, prepare the dough, and bake the bread, all in the short time 
that the witch would be away. At first she set to work bravely, but when 
she saw how hopeless her task was, she threw herself on a chair, and began 
to weep bitterly.   
She was roused from her despair by hearing Bensiabel's voice at her side 
saying. "Prunella, Prunella, do not weep like that. If you will give me a 
kiss I will make the bread, and you will be saved."   
"I will not kiss the son of a witch," replied Prunella. But Bensiabel took 
the wheat from her, and ground it, and made the dough, and when the witch 
returned the bread was ready baked in the oven.   
Turning to the girl, with fury in her voice, she said. "Bensiabel must 
have been here and helped you;" and Prunella looked down, and said 
nothing.   
"We shall see who will win in the end," said the witch, and her eyes 
blazed with anger.   
Next day she called the girl to her and said, "Go to my sister, who lives 
across the mountains. She will give you a casket, which you must bring 
back to me." This she said knowing that her sister, who was a still more 
cruel and wicked witch than herself, would never allow the girl to return, 
but would imprison her and starve her to death. But Prunella did not 
suspect anything, and set out quite cheerfully. On the way she met 
Bensiabel.   
"Where are you going, Prunella?" he asked.   
"I am going to the sister of my mistress, from whom I am to fetch a 
casket."   
"Oh poor, poor girl!" said Bensiabel. "You are being sent straight to your 
death. Give me a kiss, and I will save you."   
But again Prunella answered as before, "I will not kiss the son of a 
witch."   
"Nevertheless, I will save your life," said Bensiabel, "for I love you 
better than myself. Take this flagon of oil, this loaf of bread, this 
piece of rope, and this broom. When you reach the witch's house, oil the 
hinges of the door with the contents of the flagon, and throw the loaf of 
bread to the great fierce mastiff, who will come to meet you. When you 
have passed the dog, you will see in the courtyard a miserable woman 
trying in vain to let down a bucket into the well with her plaited hair. 
You must give her the rope. In the kitchen you will find a still more 
miserable woman trying to clean the hearth with her tongue; to her you 
must give the broom. You will see the casket on the top of a cupboard, 
take it as quickly as you can, and leave the house without a moment's 
delay. If you do all this exactly as I have told you, you will not be 
killed."   
So Prunella, having listened carefully to his instructions, did just what 
he had told her. She reached the house, oiled the hinges of the door, 
threw the loaf to the dog, gave the poor woman at the well the rope, and 
the woman in the kitchen the broom, caught up the casket from the top of 
the cupboard, and fled with it out of the house.   
But the witch heard her as she ran away, and rushing to the window called 
out to the woman in the kitchen, "Kill that thief, I tell you!"   
But the woman replied, "I will not kill her, for she has given me a broom, 
whereas you forced me to clean the hearth with my tongue."   
Then the witch called out in fury to the woman at the well. "Take the 
girl, I tell you, and fling her into the water, and drown her!"   
But the woman answered, "No, I will not drown her, for she gave me this 
rope, whereas you forced me to use my hair to let down the bucket to draw 
water."   
Then the witch shouted to the dog to seize the girl and hold her fast; but 
the dog answered, "No, I will not seize her, for she gave me a loaf of 
bread, whereas you let me starve with hunger."   
The witch was so angry that she nearly choked, as she called out, "Door, 
bang upon her, and keep her a prisoner." But the door answered, "I won't, 
for she has oiled my hinges, so that they move quite easily, whereas you 
left them all rough and rusty."   
And so Prunella escaped, and, with the casket under her arm, reached the 
house of her mistress, who, as you may believe, was as angry as she was 
surprised to see the girl standing before her, looking more beautiful than 
ever.   
Her eyes flashed, as in furious tones she asked her, "Did you meet 
Bensiabel?" But Prunella looked down, and said nothing.   
"We shall see," said the witch, "who will win in the end. Listen, there 
are three cocks in the henhouse; one is yellow, one black, and the third 
is white. If one of them crows during the night you must tell me which one 
it is. Woe to you if you make a mistake. I will gobble you up in one 
mouthful."   
Now Bensiabel was in the room next to the one where Prunella slept. At 
midnight she awoke hearing a cock crow.   
"Which one was that?" shouted the witch.   
Then, trembling, Prunella knocked on the wall and whispered. "Bensiabel, 
Bensiabel, tell me, which cock crowed?"   
"Will you give me a kiss if I tell you?" he whispered back through the 
wall.   
But she answered "No."   
Then he whispered back to her. "Nevertheless, I will tell you. It was the 
yellow cock that crowed."   
The witch, who had noticed the delay in Prunella's answer, approached her 
door calling angrily, "Answer at once, or I will kill you."   
So Prunella answered. "It was the yellow cock that crowed."   
And the witch stamped her foot and gnashed her teeth.   
Soon after another cock crowed. "Tell me now which one it is," called the 
witch.   
And, prompted by Bensiabel, Prunella answered, "That is the black cock." 
  
A few minutes after the crowing was heard again, and the voice of the 
witch demanding, "Which one was that?   
"And again Prunella implored Bensiabel to help her. But this time he 
hesitated, for he hoped that Prunella might forget that he was a witch's 
son, and promise to give him a kiss. And as he hesitated he heard an 
agonized cry from the girl. "Bensiabel, Bensiabel, save me! The witch is 
coining, she is close to me, I hear the gnashing of her teeth!"   
With a bound Bensiabel opened his door and flung himself against the 
witch. He pulled her back with such force that she stumbled, and falling 
headlong, dropped down dead at the foot of the stairs.   
Then, at last, Prunella was touched by Bensiabel's goodness and kindness 
to her, and she became his wife, and they lived happily ever after.
