A hare one day ridiculed the short feet and slow pace of the tortoise. The 
latter, laughing, said, "Though you be swift as the wind, I will beat you 
in a race." The hare, deeming her assertion to be simply impossible, 
assented to the proposal; and they agreed that the fox should choose the 
course, and fix the goal. On the day appointed for the race they started 
together. The tortoise never for a moment stopped, but went on with a slow 
but steady pace straight to the end of the course. The hare, trusting to 
his native swiftness, cared little about the race, and lying down by the 
wayside, fell fast asleep. At last waking up, and moving as fast as he 
could, he saw the tortoise had reached the goal, and was comfortably 
dozing after her fatigue.
