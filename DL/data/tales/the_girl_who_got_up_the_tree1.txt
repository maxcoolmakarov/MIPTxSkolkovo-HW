A girl who was leaving her master's service at a farm in the country told 
her sweetheart that she would meet him near a stile where they had met 
many times before. This stile was overhung by a tree. The girl got there 
before him and found a hole dug underneath the tree, and a pickaxe and 
spade lying by the side of the hole. She was much frightened at what she 
saw, and got up the tree. After she had been up the tree awhile her 
sweetheart came, and another man with him.   
Thinking that the girl had not yet come, the two men began to talk, and 
the girl heard her sweetheart say, "She will not come tonight. We'll go 
home now, and come back and kill her tomorrow night."   
As soon as they had gone the girl came down the tree and ran home to her 
father. When she had told him what she had seen, the father pondered 
awhile and then said to his daughter, "We will have a feast and ask our 
friends, and we will ask thy sweetheart to come and the man that came with 
him to the tree."   
So the two men came along with the other guests. In the evening they began 
to ask riddles of each other, but the girl who had got up the tree was the 
last to ask hers. She said:  
 
I'll rede you a riddle, I'll rede it you right,   
Where was I last Saturday night?   
The wind did blow, the leaves did shake,   
When I saw the hole the fox did make. 
 
When the two men who had intended to murder the girl heard this they ran 
out of the house.
