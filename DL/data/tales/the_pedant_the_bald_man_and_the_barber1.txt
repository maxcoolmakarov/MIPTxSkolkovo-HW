The following jest is spread --  mutatis mutandis  -- over all Europe: A pedant, a bald man, and a barber, making a journey in company, agreed to watch in turn during the night. It was the barber's watch first. He propped up the sleeping pedant, and shaved his head, and when his time came, awoke him.   
When the pedant felt his head bare, "What a fool is this barber," he cried, "for he has roused the bald man instead of me!"
