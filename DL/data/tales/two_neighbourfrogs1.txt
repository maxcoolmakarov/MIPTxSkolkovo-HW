There were two neighbour-frogs. One of them liv'd in a pond, and the other in the highway hard-by. The pond-frog, finding the water begin to fail upon the road, would fain have gotten t'other frog over to her in the pool, where she might have been safe; but she was wonted to the place, she said, and would not remove.  
And what was the end on't now, but the wheel of a cart drove over her a while after, and crush'd her to pieces.  
 The Moral: 
Some people are so listless and slothful that they'd rather lie still and die in a ditch, then stir one finger to help themselves out on't.
