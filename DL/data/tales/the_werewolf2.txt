The Werewolf 
 
 
Three workmen were mowing a meadow.  Noon came, but no one had brought 
them their meal yet, so they agreed to mow one more round and then to lie 
down beneath a bush until the food arrived.  And that is what they did.  
Two of them fell asleep immediately, because one never sleeps better than 
when one is tired, and there is no softer bed than one made from flowers 
and grass. 
The third workman, however, tied a wolf strap around his waist and crept 
up to a herd of horses that was grazing there.  The best foal was just 
right for him.  He grabbed it and killed it.  The remaining horses and 
the herder ran off.  The other harvesters saw what had happened, but they 
wisely pretended to be asleep, for they were frightened and horrified. 
After the werewolf had satisfied his hunger, he took off the strap, came 
back, and lay down to rest.  Their food soon arrived:  a large pot full 
of porridge and for each man six boiled eggs plus some bread and salt.  
As the two harvesters were helping themselves with their wooden spoons, 
the werewolf said, "Earlier I was terribly hungry, but for some reason I 
don't feel like eating now."  The two others said nothing. 
The one harvester complained the entire afternoon about cramps and a 
stomach ache, and often went to the brook to quench his burning thirst.  
The two others said nothing.  That evening, as they were on their way 
home, he said once again that he had never felt so stuffed, to which one 
of the harvesters replied that it could happen to anyone. 
When they arrived at the town gate, and he was still complaining, the 
other workman said, "A person who eats an entire foal should not be 
surprised to feel stuffed and have stomach cramps.
To that he replied, "If you had said that earlier, you would not now be 
walking home on your own legs."  He then threw his scythe away, tied the 
strap around his waist, turned into a wolf, and was never again seen in 
that place.
