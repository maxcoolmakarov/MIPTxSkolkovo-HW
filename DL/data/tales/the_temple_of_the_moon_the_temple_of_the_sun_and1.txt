Wodden's
Stone 
 
There was a custom among the lower class of people in this country which
has
entirely subsided within these twenty or thirty years.  Upon the first day
of
every new year the common people, from all parts of the country, met at
the Kirk
of Stainhouse (Stennis), each person having provision for four or five
days;
they continued there for that time dancing and feasting in the kirk.  
This meeting gave the young people an opportunity of seeing each other,
which
seldom failed in making four or five marriages every year; and to secure
each
other's love, till an opportunity of celebrating their nuptials, they had
resource to the following solemn engagements:  
The parties agreed stole from the rest of their companions, and went to
the
Temple of the Moon, where the woman, in presence of the man, fell down on
her
knees and prayed the god Wodden (for such was the name of the god they
addressed
upon this occasion) that he would enable her to perform all the promises
and
obligations she had and was to make to the young man present, after which
they
both went to the Temple of the Sun, where the man prayed in like manner
before
the woman, then they repaired from this to the stone [known as Wodden's or
Odin's Stone], and the man being on one side and the woman on the other,
they
took hold of each other's right hand through the hole, and there swore to
be
constant and faithful to each other.  
This ceremony was held so very sacred in those times that the person who
dared
to break the engagement made here was counted infamous, and excluded all
society.
