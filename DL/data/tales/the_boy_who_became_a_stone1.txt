One day a little boy named Elonen sat out in the yard making a bird snare,
and
as he worked, a little bird called to him: "Tik-tik-lo-den" (come and
catch
me). 
"I am making a snare for you," said the boy; but the bird continued to
call
until the snare was finished. 
Then Elonen ran and threw the snare over the bird and caught it, and he
put it
in a jar in his house while he went with the other boys to swim. 
While he was away, his grandmother grew hungry, so she ate the bird, and
when
Elonen returned and found that his bird was gone, he was so sad that he
wished
he might go away and never come back.  He went out into the forest and
walked a
long distance, until finally he came to a big stone and said: "Stone, open
your
mouth and eat me."  And the stone opened its mouth and swallowed the
boy. 
When his grandmother missed the boy, she went out and looked everywhere,
hoping
to find him.  Finally she passed near the stone and it cried out: "Here he
is." 
Then the old woman tried to open the stone but she could not, so she
called the
horses to come and help her.  They came and kicked it, but it would not
break. 
Then she called the carabao and they hooked it, but they only broke their
horns.
 She called the chickens, which pecked it, and the thunder, which shook
it, but
nothing could open it, and she had to go home without the boy.
