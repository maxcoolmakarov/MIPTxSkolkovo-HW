Of old time there was a great king. One day a man came before him and
said, "My king, I shall weave a turban such that one born in wedlock will
see it, while the bastard will see it not."   
The king marveled and ordered
that that weaver should weave that turban; and the weaver received an
allowance from the king and tarried a long while. One day he folded up
this side and that side of a paper and brought it and laid it before the
king and said, "Oh king, I have woven that turban."   
So the king opened the
paper and saw that there was nothing; and all the viziers and nobles who
stood there looked on the paper and saw nothing. Then the king said in his
heart, "Do you see? I am then a bastard"; and he was sad. And he thought,
"Now, the remedy is this, that I say it is a goodly turban and admire it,
else will I be put to shame before the folk." And he said, "Blessed by
God! Oh master, it is a goodly turban, I like it much." 
 Then that weaver youth said, "Oh king, let them bring a cap that I may
wind the turban for the king."   
They brought a cap, and the weaver youth
laid that paper before him and moved his hands as though he wound the
turban, and he put it on the king's head. All the nobles who were standing
there said, "Blessed be it! Oh king, how fair, how beautiful a turban!"
and they applauded it much. 
 Then the king rose and went with two viziers into a private room and
said, "Oh viziers, I am then a bastard; I see not the turban." 
 The viziers said, "Oh king, we too see it not." At length they knew of
a surety that the turban had not existence, and that that weaver had thus
played a trick for the sake of money.
