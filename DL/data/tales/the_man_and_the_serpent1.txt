A countryman's son by accident trod upon a serpent's tail, which turned
and bit him so that he died. The father in a rage got his ax, and pursuing
the serpent, cut off part of its tail. So the serpent in revenge began
stinging several of the farmer's cattle and caused him severe loss. Well,
the farmer thought it best to make it up with the serpent, and brought
food and honey to the mouth of its lair, and said to it, "Let's forget and
forgive. Perhaps you were right to punish my son, and take vengeance on my
cattle, but surely I was right in trying to revenge him. Now that we are
both satisfied, why should not we be friends again?" 
 "No, no," said the serpent. "Take away your gifts. You can never forget
the death of your son, nor I the loss of my tail. 
 Injuries may be forgiven, but not forgotten.
