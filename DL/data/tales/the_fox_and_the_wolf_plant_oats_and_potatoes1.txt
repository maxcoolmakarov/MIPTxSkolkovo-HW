[The fox and the wolf together came into possession of a piece of land.]
It was oats that they set that year, and they reaped it, and they began to 
divide it.   
"Well, then," said the fox, "wouldst thou rather have the root or the tip? 
Thou shalt have thy choice."   
"I'd rather the root," said the wolf.   
Then the fox had fine oaten bread all the year, and the other one had 
fodder.   
On the next year they set a crop; and it was potatoes that they set, and 
they grew well.   
"Which wouldst thou like best, the root or the crop this year?" said the 
fox.   
"Indeed, thou shalt not take the twist out of me anymore. I will have the 
top this year," quoth the wolf.   
"Good enough, my hero," said the fox.   
Thus the wolf had the potato tops, and the fox the potatoes. But the wolf 
used to keep stealing the potatoes from the fox.
