A withered hand was kept in the church at Bergen into the first half of
the
nineteenth century.  It came from a father murderer.  After the murderer's
death, the hand is said to have emerged from the grave.  However often
they
reburied the hand, it always came out again, until finally they chopped it
off
and put it in the church.  Punishment such as this always befalls those
who
raise a hand against their own parents.
