Now you must know that a town mouse once upon a time went on a visit to
his cousin in the country. He was rough and ready, this cousin, but he
loved his town friend and made him heartily welcome. Beans and bacon,
cheese and bread, were all he had to offer, but he offered them freely.
The town mouse rather turned up his long nose at this country fare, and
said, "I cannot understand, cousin, how you can put up with such poor food
as this, but of course you cannot expect anything better in the country;
come you with me and I will show you how to live. When you have been in
town a week you will wonder how you could ever have stood a country life."
No sooner said than done: The two mice set off for the town and arrived at
the town mouse's residence late at night. 
 "You will want some refreshment after our long journey," said the
polite town mouse, and took his friend into the grand dining room. There
they found the remains of a fine feast, and soon the two mice were eating
up jellies and cakes and all that was nice. Suddenly they heard growling
and barking. 
 "What is that?" said the country mouse. 
 "It is only the dogs of the house," answered the other. 
 "Only," said the country mouse, "I do not like that music at my
dinner!" Just at that moment the door flew open; in came two huge
mastiffs; and the two mice had to scamper down and run off. 
 "Good-bye, cousin," said the country mouse. 
 "What! Going so soon?" said the other. 
 "Yes," he replied. "Better beans and bacon in peace than cakes and ale
in fear."
