Hun Graves at Züssow   
Ages ago there were two large, ancient Hun Graves on the Buggenhagen 
Estate at Züssow.  In the year 1594 the people of Greifswald needed 
stones for a building, and upon their request the Buggenhagens gave them 
permission to take the stones from the two Hun graves.  After the 
Greifswald stonemasons had cut up the large stones they became curious 
about what might be buried in the earth beneath them.  They therefore 
began to dig into one of the graves, where they found many human corpses.  
They were completely preserved and enormously large.  They measured 
between eleven and sixteen feet in length, and they all lay in a row.  
Between each one there was a jar filled with earth.  When they began 
digging into the second grave they heard a great commotion beneath the 
earth, as though people were dancing and rattling bunches of keys.  This 
so frightened them that they ceased their digging.
