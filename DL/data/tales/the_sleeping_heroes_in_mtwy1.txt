It is said that many years ago in the vicinity of the village of MÄ…twy a terrible battle with the Tartars took place in which all the warriors were killed except for their leader.  According to legend these warriors are now resting in a deep sleep beneath the church. Their leader is keeping watch over them.  
In earlier times the cavern in which they are resting was not very deep beneath the earth. Thus once a girl happened to discover the entrance.  She went inside and became very frightend when she saw the warriors. The leader told her to fear not, but warned her not to touch the bell hanging in the entrance.  
The girl disobeyed him and carelessly touched the bell.  It began to ring, and the sound of the bell woke the warriors from their sleep. They took up their weapons. The angry leader then sunk himself and his army so deep into the earth that they were never again found.  
However, if enemies ever threaten the land he himself will awaken them from their sleep and lead them to glorious victories.
