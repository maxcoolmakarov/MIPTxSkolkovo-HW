Once on a time the was a merchant's son, who had spent all his father's wealth, and had only an iron balance left to him. Now the balance was made of a thousand  palas  of iron; and depositing it in the care of a certain merchant, he went to another land.   
And when, on his return, he came to that merchant to demand back his balance, the merchant said to him, "It has been eaten by mice." He repeated, "It is quite true, the iron, of which it was composed, was particularly sweet, and so the mice ate it."   
This he said with an outward show of sorrow, laughing in his heart. Then the merchant's son asked him to give him some food, and he, being in a good temper, consented to give him some.   
Then the merchant's son went to bathe, taking with him the son of that merchant, who was a mere child, and whom he persuaded to come with him by giving him a dish of  Ã¡malakas . And after he had bathed, the wise merchant's son deposited the boy in the house of a friend, and returned alone to the house of that merchant.   
And the merchant said to him, "Where is that son of mine?"   
He replied, "A kite swooped down from the air and carried him off."   
The merchant in a rage said, "You have concealed my son," and so he took him into the king's judgment hall; and there the merchant's son made the same statement.   
The officers of the court said, " This is impossible, how could a kite carry off a boy?"   
But the merchant's son answered, " In a country where a large balance of iron was eaten by mice, a kite might carry off an elephant, much more a boy."   
When the officers heard that, they asked about it, out of curiosity, and made the merchant restore the balance to the owner, and he, for his part, restored the merchant's child.
