There is a great big mountain. On the mountain there is a rock-hole [containing water]. In it there are some small fishes. At all other places a heron eats the small fishes. In this rock-hole the heron cannot eat the small fishes; he goes along [in the air], above the rock cave.  
On account of it, the heron puts on a false appearance. "I am indeed an ascetic," he said. "I do not kill living creatures," he said.  
Thereupon the small fishes came for a talk. After they came he said, "Being in this hole ye cannot go up and down," he said. "Because it is so, I will take you and put you in a river possessing length and breadth," he said.  
After that, having taken them one by one he ate them. At the time when he was taking the crab which remained over from them, the crab took hold of the neck of the heron. While on the way, when the heron was preparing to kill the crab, the crab getting to know of it, cut the neck of the heron with his claws and killed it.
