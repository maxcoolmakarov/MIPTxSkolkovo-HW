Seven men of Buneyr once left their native wilds for the purpose of
seeking their fortunes.  When evening came they all sat down under a tree
to rest, when one of them said, "Let us count to see if we are all here."
So he counted, "One, two, three, four, five, six," but, quite omitting to
reckon himself, he exclaimed, "There's one of us missing. We are only
six!"  
 "Nonsense!" cried the others, and 
the whole company of seven began counting with uplifted forefingers, but
they all forgot to count themselves. 
 Fearing some evil, they now rose up, and at once set out to search for
their missing comrade.  Presently they met a shepherd, who greeted them
civilly and said, "Friends, why are you in such low spirits?" 
 "We have lost one of our party," answered they; "we started this
morning seven in number, and now we are only six.  Have you seen any one
of us hereabouts?" 
 "But," said the shepherd, "seven you are, for I have found your lost
companion; behold:  one, two, three, four, five, six,  seven! " 
 "Ah," answered the wise men of Buneyr, "you have indeed found our
missing brother. We owe you a debt of gratitude."
