You must know that once upon a time Reynard the Fox and Bruin the Bear 
went into partnership and kept house together. Would you like to know the 
reason? Well, Reynard knew that Bruin had a beehive full of honeycomb, 
and that was what he wanted; but Bruin kept so close a guard upon his 
honey that Master Reynard didn't know how to get away from him and get 
hold of the honey.   
So one day he said to Bruin, "Pardner, I have to go and be gossip -- that 
means godfather, you know -- to one of my old friends."   
"Why, certainly," said Bruin.   
So off Reynard goes into the woods, and after a time he crept back and 
uncovered the beehive and had such a feast of honey. Then he went back to 
Bruin, who asked him what name had been given to the child. Reynard had 
forgotten all about the christening and could only say, "Just-begun."   
"What a funny name," said Master Bruin.   
A little while after Reynard thought he would like another feast of honey. 
So he told Bruin that he had to go to another christening; and off he 
went. And when he came back and Bruin asked him what was the name given to 
the child Reynard said, "Half-eaten."   
The third time the same thing occurred, and this time the name given by 
Reynard to the child that didn't exist was "All-gone." You can guess why. 
  
A short time afterwards Master Bruin thought he would like to eat up some 
of his honey and asked Reynard to come and join him in the feast. When 
they got to the beehive Bruin was so surprised to find that there was no 
honey left; and he turned round to Reynard and said, "Just-begun, Half- 
eaten, All-gone -- so that is what you meant; you have eaten my honey." 
  
"Why no," said Reynard, "how could that be? I have never stirred from your 
side except when I went a-gossiping, and then I was far away from here. 
You must have eaten the honey yourself, perhaps when you were asleep; at 
any rate we can easily tell; let us lie down here in the sunshine, and if 
either of us has eaten the honey, the sun will soon sweat it out of us." 
  
No sooner said than done, and the two lay side by side in the sunshine. 
Soon Master Bruin commenced to doze, and Mr. Reynard took some honey from 
the hive and smeared it round Bruin's snout; then he woke him up and said, 
"See, the honey is oozing out of your snout; you must have eaten it when 
you were asleep."   
Some time after this Reynard saw a man driving a cart full of fish, which 
made his mouth water. So he ran and he ran and he ran till he got far away 
in front of the cart and lay down in the road as still as if he were dead. 
  
When the man came up to him and saw him lying there dead, as he thought, 
he said to himself, "Why, that will make a beautiful red fox scarf and 
muff for my wife Ann."   
And he got down and seized hold of Reynard and threw him into the cart all 
along with the fish, and then he went driving on as before. Reynard began 
to throw the fish out till there were none left, and then he jumped out 
himself without the man noticing it, who drove up to his door and called 
out, "Ann, Ann, see what I have brought you."   
And when his wife came to the door she looked into the cart and said, 
"Why, there is nothing there."   
Reynard in the meantime had brought all his fish together and began eating 
some when up comes Bruin and asked for a share.   
"No, no," said Reynard, "we only share food when we have shared work. I 
fished for these, you go and fish for others."   
"Why, how could you fish for these? The water is all frozen over," said 
Bruin.   
"I'll soon show you," said Reynard, and brought him down to the bank of 
the river, and pointed to a hole in the ice and said, "I put my tail in 
that, and the fish were so hungry I couldn't draw them up quick enough. 
Why do you not do the same?"   
So Bruin put his tail down and waited and waited but no fish came. "Have 
patience, man," said Reynard; "as soon as one fish comes the rest will 
follow."   
"Ah, I feel a bite," said Bruin, as the water commenced to freeze round 
his tail and caught it in the ice.   
"Better wait till two or three have been caught and then you can catch 
three at a time. I'll go back and finish my lunch."   
And with that Master Reynard trotted up to the man's wife and said to her, 
"Ma'am, there's a big black bear caught by the tail in the ice; you can do 
what you like with him."   
So the woman called her husband and they took big sticks and went down to 
the river and commenced whacking Bruin who, by this time, was fast in the 
ice. He pulled and he pulled and he pulled, till at last he got away 
leaving three quarters of his tail in the ice, and that is why bears have 
such short tails up to the present day.   
Meanwhile Master Reynard was having a great time in the man's house, 
golloping everything he could find till the man and his wife came back and 
found him with his nose in the cream jug. As soon as he heard them come in 
he tried to get away, but not before the man had seized hold of the cream 
jug and thrown it at him, just catching him on the tail, and that is the 
reason why the tips of foxes' tails are cream white to this very day.   
Well, Reynard crept home and found Bruin in such a state, who commenced to 
grumble and complain that it was all Reynard's fault that he had lost his 
tail.   
So Reynard pointed to his own tail and said, "Why, that's nothing; see my 
tail; they hit me so hard upon the head my brains fell out upon my tail. 
Oh, how bad I feel; won't you carry me to my little bed."   
So Bruin, who was a good-hearted soul, took him upon his back and rolled 
with him towards the house. And as he went on Reynard kept saying, "The 
sick carries the sound, the sick carries the sound."   
"What's that you are saying?" asked Bruin.   
"Oh, I have no brains left, I do not know what I am saying," said Reynard 
but kept on singing, "The sick carries the sound, ha, ha, the sick carries 
the sound."   
Then Bruin knew that he had been done and threw Reynard down upon the 
ground, and would have eaten him up but that the fox slunk away and rushed 
into a briar bush. Bruin followed him closely into the briar bush and 
caught Reynard's hind leg in his mouth. Then Reynard called out, "That's 
right, you fool, bite the briar root, bite the briar root."   
Bruin thinking that he was biting the briar root, let go Reynard's foot 
and snapped at the nearest briar root. "That's right, now you've got me, 
don't hurt me too much," called out Reynard, and slunk away. "Don't hurt 
me too much, don't hurt me too much."   
When Bruin heard Reynard's voice dying away in the distance he knew that 
he had been done again, and that was the end of their partnership.   
Some time after this a man was plowing in the field with his two oxen, who 
were very lazy that day. So the man called out at them, "Get a move on or 
I'll give you to the bear"; and when they didn't quicken their pace he 
tried to frighten them by calling out, "Bear, Bear, come and take these 
lazy oxen."   
Sure enough, Bruin heard him and came out of the woods and said, "Here I 
am, give me the oxen, or else it'll be worse for you."   
The man was in despair but said, "Yes, yes, of course they are yours, but 
please let me finish my morning's plowing so I may finish this acre."   
Bruin could not say "No" to that, and sat down licking his chops and 
waiting for the oxen. The man went on plowing, thinking what he should do, 
when just at the corner of the field Reynard came up to him and said, "If 
you will give me two geese, I'll help you out of this fix and deliver the 
bear into your hands."   
The man agreed and he told him what to do and went away into the woods. 
Soon after, the bear and the man heard a noise like "bow-wow, bow-wow"; 
and the Bear came to the man and said, "What's that?"   
"Oh, that must be the lord's hounds out hunting for bears."   
"Hide me, hide me," said Bruin, "and I will let you off the oxen."   
Then Reynard called out from the wood, "What's that black thing you've got 
there?"   
And the Bear said, "Say it's the stump of a tree."   
So when the man had called this out to the fox, Reynard called out, "Put 
it in the cart; fix it with the chain; cut off the boughs, and drive your 
axe into the stump."   
Then the bear said to the man, "Pretend to do what he bids you; heave me 
into the cart; bind me with the chain; pretend to cut off the boughs, and 
drive the axe into the stump."   
So the man lifted Bruin into the cart, bound him with the chain, then cut 
off his limbs and buried the axe in his head.  
Then Reynard came forward and asked for his reward, and the man went back 
to his house to get the pair of geese that he had promised.   
"Wife, wife," he called out, as he neared the house, "get me a pair of 
geese, which I have promised the fox for ridding me of the bear."   
"I can do better than that," said his wife Ann, and brought him out a bag 
with two struggling animals in it.  
"Give these to Master Reynard," said she; "they will be geese enough for 
him." So the man took the bag and went down to the field and gave the bag 
to Reynard, but when he opened it out sprang two hounds, and he had great 
trouble in running away from them to his den.   
When he got to his den the fox asked each of his limbs, how they had 
helped him in his flight. His nose said, "I smelt the hounds"; his eyes 
said, "We looked for the shortest way"; his ears said, "We listened for 
the breathing of the hounds"; and his legs said, "We ran away with you." 
  
Then he asked his tail what it had done, and it said, "Why, I got caught 
in the bushes or made your leg stumble; that is all I could do."   
So, as a punishment, the fox stuck his tail out of his den, and the hounds 
saw it and caught hold of it, and dragged the fox out of his den by it and 
ate him all up. So that was the end of Master Reynard, and well he 
deserved it. Don't you think so?
