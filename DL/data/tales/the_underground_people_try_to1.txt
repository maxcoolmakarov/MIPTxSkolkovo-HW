Steal a Child 
 
  Legends, Tales, and Customs from Mecklenburg   
In Lanken near Parchim a peasant woman was lying in bed one night with 
her small child that had not yet been baptized.  Because the moon was 
shining, she blew out the light.  Then she suddenly noticed that a little 
woman was standing at the door next to the bell.  She came to the bed and 
took hold of the boy and wanted to take him away.  The peasant woman held 
as fast as she could, but the small person was pulling almost stronger 
than she was.  Then the peasant woman called for her husband, and when he 
struck a light, the little woman disappeared.
