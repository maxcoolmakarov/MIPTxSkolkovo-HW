Once upon a time a son was born to a certain raja, and the child had
the ears of an ox. The raja was very much ashamed and let no one know. But
the secret could not be kept from the barber who had to perform the
ceremony of shaving the child's head. However, the raja made the barber
vow not to tell anyone of what he had seen. 
 So the barber went away, but the secret which he might not tell had an
unfortunate effect. It made his stomach swell to an enormous size. As the
barber went along in this unhappy condition he met a Dom [member of a low
caste, comprising scavangers, basketmakers, and drummers] who asked why
his stomach was so swollen. The barber said that it was because he had
shaved the raja's child and had seen that it had the ears of an ox.
Directly he had broken his vow and blurted out the secret, his stomach
returned to its usual size. 
 The Dom went his way and cut down a tree and made a drum out of the
wood, and went about playing on the drum and begging. He came to the
raja's palace, and there he drummed and sang: 
 The son of the raja 
Has the ears of an ox. 
 When the raja heard this, he was very angry, and swore to punish the
barber who must have broken his vow. But the Dom assured the raja that he
knew nothing about the matter, that it was the drum that sang the words
and not he, and that he had no idea what they meant. So the raja was
pacified, and the barber was not punished.
