Summary 
A father, having given his estate to his son at the time of the young man's marriage, becomes a burden in his old age, whereupon his ungrateful daughter-in-law conspires to drive him forth.  It is cold, and the old man begs that at least he shall be provided with a garment against the weather.  The unnatural son sends his own young boy to fetch the horse-blanket, and the child returns with but half of it.    
"Why did you cut it in two?" asks his father.   
To which the little one responds that he is keeping the other half for the day when he, too, will show his father the door.    
Whereupon the unnatural son repents, and full amends are made to the old man.
