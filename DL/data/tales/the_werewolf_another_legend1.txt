A married couple in Hessen lived in poverty.  To the husband's amazement,
the
wife nevertheless was able to serve meat for every meal.  For a long time
she
kept it a secret where she got the meat, but finally she promised to
reveal it
to him, under the condition that he not call out her name as it was
happening. 
Together they went to a field where a herd of sheep was grazing.  The
woman
walked toward the sheep, and as she approached them, she threw a ring over
herself and instantly turned into a werewolf.  She fell upon the sheep,
seized
one of them, and fled.  The man stood there as though petrified.  However,
when
he saw the shepherd and the dogs running after the werewolf, thus
endangering
his wife, he forgot his promise and called out: "Margaret!"  With that the
wolf
disappeared, and the woman was left standing naked in the field.
