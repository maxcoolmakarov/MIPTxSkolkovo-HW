The Holy One gathered the dust for the creation of the first man from the 
four corners of the earth, The Spirit of Life asked God why did He do 
this.   
The Holy One replied, "If a man should chance to come from the East to the 
West, or from the West to the East or to any place on the face of the 
earth, and his time comes to depart from this world, then the dust of the 
earth which is in that place where he dies shall not say to him: 'The dust 
of thy body is not mine. Thou wast not born here in this land. Return to 
the place whence thy dust was gathered at thy birth.' It is for this 
reason that I have taken the dust to form man from the four corners of the 
earth. Every place on earth is man's home. Wheresoever he happens to be 
when he dies there is the resting-place for the dust of his body and there 
it returns to Mother-Earth."   
The Spirit of Life praised the Lord whose mercies are over all His works.
