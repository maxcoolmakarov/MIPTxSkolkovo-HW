A peasant once went to the gardener's, to steal cucumbers. He crept up to 
the cucumbers, and thought, "I will carry off a bag of cucumbers, which I 
will sell; with the money I will buy a hen. The hen will lay eggs, hatch 
them, and raise a lot of chicks. I will feed the chicks and sell them; 
then I will buy me a young sow, and she will bear a lot of pigs. I will 
sell the pigs, and buy me a mare; the mare will foal me some colts. I will 
raise the colts, and sell them. I will buy me a house, and start a garden. 
In the garden I will sow cucumbers, and will not let them be stolen, but 
will keep a sharp watch on them. I will hire watchmen, and put them in the 
cucumber patch, while I myself will come on them, unawares, and shout, 
'Oh, there, keep a sharp lookout!'"   
And this he shouted as loud as he could. The watchmen heard it, and they 
rushed out and beat the peasant.
