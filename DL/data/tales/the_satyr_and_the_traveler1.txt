Within a savage forest grot 
A satyr and his chips  
Were taking down their porridge hot;  
Their cups were at their lips.
 
You might have seen in mossy den, 
Himself, his wife, and brood;  
They had not tailor-clothes, like men,  
But appetites as good.
 
In came a traveller, benighted, 
All hungry, cold, and wet,  
Who heard himself to eat invited  
With nothing like regret.
 
He did not give his host the pain 
His asking to repeat;  
But first he blew with might and main  
To give his fingers heat.
 
Then in his steaming porridge dish 
He delicately blew.  
The wondering satyr said, "I wish  
The use of both I knew."
 
"Why, first, my blowing warms my hand,    
And then it cools my porridge."  
"Ah!" said his host, "then understand     
I cannot give you storage.  
To sleep beneath one roof with you,  
I may not be so bold.  
Far be from me that mouth untrue  
Which blows both hot and cold."
