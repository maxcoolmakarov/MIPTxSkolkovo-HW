Malchus was the head of the Jews who killed our Lord. The Lord pardoned
them all, and likewise the good thief, but he never pardoned Malchus,
because it was he who gave the Madonna a blow.  
 He is confined under a mountain, and condemned to walk around a column,
without resting, as long as the world lasts. Every time that he walks
about the column he gives it a blow in memory of the blow he gave the
mother of our Lord. He has walked around the column so long that he has
sunk into the ground. He is now up to his neck. When he is under, head and
all, the world will come to an end, and God will then send him to the
place prepared for him. He asks all those who go to see him (for there are
such) whether children are yet born; and when they say yes, he gives a
deep sigh and resumes his walk, saying: "The time is not yet!" for before
the world comes to an end there will be no children born for seven
years.
