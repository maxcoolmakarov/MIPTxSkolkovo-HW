Once there was a chicky who went walking in a field.  Suddenly he began to run until he came to ducky.  
Ducky said, "Chicky, why are you running?" 
"Because the sky is falling in!" 
"Chicky, who told you so?" 
"A piece of it fell on my head." 
So the ducky ran along too. 
After a while they came to Goosey, and Goosey said, "Why are you running?" 
Ducky said, "Because the sky is falling in!"  
"Ducky, who told you so?"  
"Chicky told me so." 
"Chicky, who told you so." 
"A piece of it fell on my head."  
So Goosey ran along too. 
After a while they came to Doggy, and Doggy said, "Why are you running?"  
Goosey said, "Because the sky is falling in!" 
"Goosey, who told you so?" 
"Ducky told me so." 
"Ducky, who told you so?"  
"Chicky told me so." 
"Chicky, who told you so." 
"A piece of it fell on my head."  
So Doggy ran along too. 
After a while they came to Bunny, and Bunny said, "Why are you running?"  
Doggy said, "Because the sky is falling in!" 
"Doggy, who told you so?"  
"Goosey told me so."  
"Goosey, who told you so?" 
"Ducky told me so." 
"Ducky, who told you so?"  
"Chicky told me so." 
"Chicky, who told you so." 
"A piece of it fell on my head."  
So Bunny ran along too. 
After a while they came to Calfy, and Calfy said, "Why are you running?"  
Bunny said, "Because the sky is falling in!" 
"Who told you so?" 
"Doggy told me so." 
"Doggy, who told you so?"  
"Goosey told me so."  
"Goosey, who told you so?" 
"Ducky told me so." 
"Ducky, who told you so?"  
"Chicky told me so." 
"Chicky, who told you so." 
"A piece of it fell on my head."  
So the calfy ran along too. 
After a while they came to a little boy, and the little boy said, "Why are you animals running?"  
All together they shouted "Hey! The sky is falling in!"  
"Where?" 
"At Chicky's place.  A piece of it fell on his head."  
So they took the little boy with them to Chicky's place. It began to rain, and they took shelter under a cherry tree, and a little twig fell onto the little boy's back, and he said, "The sky must be falling in!"   
With that the animals were so ashamed that they all ran away.  They are still running, and if you catch one of them, you can keep him.
