A hare insulted a tortoise on account of his slowness, and vainly boasted 
of her own great speed in running.   
"Let us make a match," replied the tortoise. "I'll run you five miles for 
five pounds, and the fox yonder shall be umpire of the race."   
The hare agreed, and away they both started together; but the hare, by 
reason of her exceeding swiftness, outran the tortoise to such a degree 
that she made a jest of the matter, and finding herself a little tired, 
squatted in a tuft of fern that grew by the way, and took a nap, thinking 
that if the tortoise went by, she could at any time fetch him up with all 
the ease imaginable.   
In the meanwhile the tortoise came jogging along at a slow but continued 
pace, and the hare, out of too great security and confidence of victory, 
oversleeping herself, the tortoise arrived at the end of the race first.
