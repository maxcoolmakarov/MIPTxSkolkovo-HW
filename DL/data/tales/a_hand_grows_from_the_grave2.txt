About four hundred years ago in Heidelberg it happened that a hand grew
out of the grave of a newly buried child, who was eight years old. 
 In response to this miracle the clergy conducted prayers and
processions and investigated the child's life, discovering that he had
often struck his parents. 
 His mother was now sentenced to make up for the delayed discipline. She
was required to beat the child's hand thoroughly with a thick switch, and
after she had done this for a time, the hand withdrew back into the grave
and stayed there from that time forth.
