The story goes: A man of trade,   
In Persia, with his neighbor made   
Deposit, as he left the state,  
Of iron, say a hundredweight.  

Return'd, said he, "My iron, neighbor."   
"Your iron! you have lost your labor;   
I grieve to say it, -- 'pon my soul,   
A rat has eaten up the whole.   
My men were sharply scolded at,   
But yet a hole, in spite of that,   
Was left, as one is wont to be   
In every barn or granary,   
By which crept in that cursed rat."  

Admiring much the novel thief,   
The man affected full belief.  

Ere long, his faithless neighbor's child   
He stole away, -- a heavy lad, --   
And then to supper bade the dad,   
Who thus plead off in accents sad:   
"It was but yesterday I had   
A boy as fine as ever smiled,   
An only son, as dear as life,   
The darling of myself and wife.   
Alas! we have him now no more,   
And every joy with us is o'er."  

Replied the merchant, "Yesternight,   
By evening's faint and dusky ray,   
I saw a monstrous owl alight,   
And bear your darling son away   
To yonder tott'ring ruin gray."  

"Can I believe you, when you say   
An owl bore off so large a prey?   
How could it be?" the father cried;   
"The thing is surely quite absurd;  
 My son with ease had kill'd the bird."   

"The how of it," the man replied,   
"Is not my province to decide;   
I know I saw your son arise,   
Borne through the air before my eyes.   
Why should it seem a strange affair,   
Moreover, in a country where   
A single rat contrives to eat  
 A hundred pounds of iron meat,   
That owls should be of strength to lift ye   
A booby boy that weighs but fifty?"  

The other plainly saw the trick,   
Restored the iron very quick,   
And got, with shame as well as joy,   
Possession of his kidnapp'd boy.
