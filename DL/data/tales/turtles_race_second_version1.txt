Once a Turtle was resting itself on the surface of a lake, when he
saw something strange coming towards him. Not knowing what
it could possibly be, he went out to meet it, and when he came
close to it, he found that it was a boat. When the men in the boat
saw the Turtle, they stopped and asked if he knew of anyone who
would race them around the lake. They said that they would pay
anyone who would beat them.   
The Turtle said, "I know one who would beat you."  
"Would you go and get him?" said the men.  
The Turtle said, "I am the one."   
So the men challenged him, but he would only race on one condition, and that was that he might
run under the water and go around the lake close to the shore,
and in order that they might know where he was he would tie a red
ribbon around his neck.   
The men then asked the Turtle what he would bet for the race, and the Turtle answered, "My life."  
Then the men said, "Well, tomorrow morning you get ready and
come around with that ribbon around your neck, and we will
race you."  
During the night the Turtle called together some of his brothers,
and tied a red ribbon round each of their necks. Then he placed
them a distance apart all around the lake. In the morning the
Turtle went to the place which they had picked out as their starting
point, and found the men already there.   
When the word "go"
was given, the boat started off and the Turtle dropped underneath
the surface of the water. When the Turtle rose to the surface
again, the boat was right abreast of him, and when the Turtle
rose a second time, the boat people noticed that the Turtle was
gaining on them. When finally, the last Turtle rose, the boat
was only half way round.  
The Turtle won the race and got the reward.
