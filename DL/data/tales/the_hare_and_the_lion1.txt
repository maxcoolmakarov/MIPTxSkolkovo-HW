[After several unsuccessful attempts to capture the hare, the lion asked some people], "Where is the hare's house?"   
And they told him, "We do not know."    
And the hare had said to his wife, "Let us remove from this house." And they removed.   
And the lion went asking, and people told him, "That is his house on the top of the mountain."   
And the lion went, and when he arrived, the hare was not there. And he said, "I will hide myself inside the house, till when the hare comes with his wife, I will eat them both."   
And the hare came, he and his wife. He had heard nothing, till on the road he saw the lion's feet, and he said to his wife, "You go back, the lion has passed this way looking for me."   
And she said, "I will not go back, I will follow you, my husband."   
And he said, "You have friends to go to, go back."   
And she went back. And the hare went on and followed the feet, and saw that they went into his house. And he said [to himself], "Oho, lion! you are inside."   
And he went back cautiously, and went and stood at a distance, and said, "Salaam house! Salaam house! Salaam house!"   
And he heard no reply. And the hare said, "How is this? Every day as I pass this place, if I say, 'Salaam,' the house answers me; but today perhaps there is someone inside it."   
The lion was deceived, and replied, "Salaam."  
And he said to him, "Oho, lion! you are inside, you want to eat me, your son. And where did you hear of a house's talking?"   
And the lion said, "Wait for me, that's all."   
And the hare ran off, and they chased one another till the lion was tired. And he said to the people, "The hare has beaten me; there, I do not want him any more." And he went back.
