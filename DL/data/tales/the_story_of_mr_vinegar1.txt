Mr. and Mrs. Vinegar lived in a vinegar bottle. 
 Now one day, when Mr. Vinegar was away from home, Mrs. Vinegar, who was
a very good housewife, was busily sweeping her house, when an unlucky
thump of the broom brought the whole house clitter-clatter,
clitter-clatter, about her ears. In a paroxysm of grief she rushed forth
to meet her husband. On seeing him she exclaimed, "Oh, Mr. Vinegar, Mr.
Vinegar, we are ruined, we are ruined. I have knocked the house down, and
it is all to pieces!" 
 Mr. Vinegar then said, "My dear, let us see what can be done. Here is
the door; I will take it on my back, and we will go forth to seek our
fortune." 
 They walked all that day, and at nightfall entered a thick forest. They
were both excessively tired, and Mr. Vinegar said, "My love, I will climb
up into a tree, drag up the door, and you shall follow." He according did
so, and they both stretched their weary limbs on the door, and fell fast
asleep. In the middle of the night Mr. Vinegar was disturbed by the sound
of voices beneath, and to his inexpressible dismay perceived that a party
of thieves were wet to divide their booty. 
 "Here, Jack," said one, "here's five pounds for you. Here, Bill, here's
ten pounds for you. Here, Bob, here's three pounds for you." 
 Mr. Vinegar could listen no longer. His terror was so intense that he
trembled most violently, and shook down the door on their heads. Away
scampered the thieves, but Mr. Vinegar dared not quit his retreat till
broad daylight. He then scrambled out of the tree, and went to lift up the
door. What did he behold but a number of golden guineas! 
 "Come down, Mrs. Vinegar," he cried. "Come down, I say. Our fortune's
made, our fortune's made! Come down, I say." 
 Mrs. Vinegar got down as fast as she could, and saw the money with
equal delight. "Now, my dear," said she, "I'll tell you what you shall do.
There is a fair at the neighboring town. You shall take these forty
guineas and buy a cow. I can make butter and cheese, which you shall sell
at market, and we shall then be able to live very comfortably." 
 Mr. Vinegar joyfully assents, takes the money, and goes off to the
fair. When he arrived, he walked up and down, and at length saw a
beautiful red cow. It was an excellent milker, and perfect in every
respect. "Oh!" thought Mr. Vinegar, "If I had but that cow I should be the
happiest man alive." So he offers the forty guineas for the cow, and the
owner declaring that, as he was a friend, he'd oblige him, the bargain was
made. Proud of his purchase, he drove the cow backwards and forwards to
show it. 
 By and by he saw a man playing the bagpipes, tweedle-dum, tweedle-dee.
The children followed him about, and he appeared to be pocketing money on
all sides. "Well," thought Mr. Vinegar, "if I had but that beautiful
instrument I should be the happiest man alive. My fortune would be made."
So he went up to the man, "Friend," says he, "what a beautiful instrument
that is, and what a deal of money you must make." 
 "Why, yes," said the man, "I make a great deal of money, to be sure,
and it is a wonderful instrument." 
 "Oh!" cried Mr. Vinegar, "how I should like to possess it!" 
 "Well," said the man, "as you are a friend, I don't much mind parting
with it. You shall have it for that red cow." 
 "Done," said the delighted Mr. Vinegar. So the beautiful red cow was
given for the bagpipes. He walked up and down with his purchase, but in
vain he attempted to play a tune, and instead of pocketing pence, the boys
followed him hooting, laughing, and pelting. Poor Mr. Vinegar, his fingers
grew very cold, and, heartily ashamed and mortified, he was leaving the
town, when he met a man with a fine thick pair of gloves. 
 "Oh, my fingers are so very cold," said Mr. Vinegar to himself. "If I
had but those beautiful gloves I should be the happiest man alive." He
went up to the man, and said to him, "Friend, you seem to have a capital
pair of gloves there." 
 "Yes, truly," cried the man; "and my hands are as warm as possible this
cold November day." 
 "Well," said Mr. Vinegar, "I should like to have them." 
 "What will you give?" said the man. "As you are a friend, I don't much
mind letting you have them for those bagpipes." 
 "Done," cried Mr. Vinegar. He put on the gloves, and felt perfectly
happy as he trudged homewards.  
 At last he grew very tired, when he saw a man coming towards him with a
good stout stick in his hand. "Oh," said Mr. Vinegar, "that I had but that
stick! I should then be the happiest man alive." 
 He accosted the man, "Friend! What a rare good stick you have got." 
 "Yes," said the man, "I have used it for many a long mile, and a good
friend it has been, but if you have a fancy for it, as you are a friend, I
don't mind giving it to you for that pair of gloves." 
 Mr. Vinegar's hands were so warm, and his legs so tired, that he gladly
exchanged. As he drew near to the wood where he had left his wife, he
heard a parrot on a tree calling out his name, "Mr. Vinegar, you foolish
man, you blockhead, you simpleton; you went to the fair and laid out all
your money in buying a cow. Not content with that, you changed it for
bagpipes on which you could not play, and which were not worth one tenth
of the money. You fool, you -- you had no sooner got the bagpipes than you
changed them for the gloves, which were not worth one quarter of the
money; and when you had got the gloves, you changed them for a poor
miserable stick; and now for your forty guineas, cow, bagpipes, and
gloves, you have nothing to show but that poor miserable stick, which you
might have cut in any hedge." 
 On this the bird laughed immoderately, and Mr. Vinegar, falling into a
violent rage, threw the stick at its head. The stick lodged in the tree,
and he returned to his wife without money, cow, bagpipes, gloves, or
stick, and she instantly gave him such a sound cudgeling that she almost
broke every bone in his skin.
