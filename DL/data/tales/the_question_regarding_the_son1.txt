A certain woman, carrying her infant son, went to the
Pandit's [future Buddha's] tank, and having bathed her son and placed him
on her clothes, descended into the pond to wash her head
and bathe herself.   
Immediately after she had gone down
to bathe, a Yakinni, observing her son, and wishing to
eat him, took the form of a woman, and coming near the
child, said to the woman, "Friend, this child is very
pretty. Is he yours?"   
On her saying "Yes," the Yakinni asked her,
"Shall I give the child suck?"   
And when she replied, "Very well," the Yakinni took up the
child, gave it a little milk, and ran away with it.   
The mother, seeing the woman running away with her child,
ran after her, and asking her, "Where are you taking my
child to?" caught hold of her.   
The Yakinni then fearlessly replied,
"Where did you get a child from? This one is my own son."   
These two were thus quarrelling, and passing by the gate of the "Hall," when the Bosat 
[future Buddha], hearing the
noise of their quarrel, sent for both, and inquired of them
what the cause of their dispute was; and recognising the
Yakinni from the fact of her not winking, and her eyes
being as red as  olinda  seeds, he inquired,
"Will you abide by my decision?" and on their agreeing to do so, he caused
a line to be drawn on the ground, and the child to be laid
exactly in the middle of the line.   
He then ordered the
Yakinni to take hold of the child's two arms, and the
mother the two legs, and said, "Now, both of you pull
away, and whosoever pulls the child over the line will be
declared the mother."   
They accordingly pulled the child,
which suffered grievous pain thereby (and cried).   
The mother, whose heart burst with sorrow, then let go the
child and stood weeping.   
The Bosat then inquired from those who were present,
"Whose heart is tender towards
children? Is it that of the mother or of the stranger?"  
Many answered, "Pandit! the heart of a mother is
tender."   
Having heard this, the Pandit inquired of all,
"What now do you think? Is it the woman who has the
child in her arms that is the mother, or the woman who
let go the child?"   
Everyone said, "O Pandit! the woman who has let go the child is the mother."   
Then the Pandit asked them, "Do you all know now who it is
that has stolen the child?"   
And when they replied, "Pandit! we do not know," he said,
"Oh! this woman is a Yakinni, and she has taken the child to eat it."   
The people then asked the Pandit, "How do you know it?"  
And he replied, "Because her eyes are red and never wink,
and she neither fears nor loves anybody. It is thus that
I found out that she is a Yakinni."   
Having thus spoken, the Pandit asked her, "Who are you?"   
She replied, "I am a Yakiuni."   
"Why did you take away this child?"   
"Lord! to eat him," she replied.   
The Pandit then warning her, said, "Hear me! you foolish one. Because you
committed sin in your last birth, you have been born a
Yakinni; nevertheless, you commit sin still! Oh ! how
foolish thou art!"  
After that, exhorting her, he made
her take the "Pansil," [five moral precepts] and sent her away.   
The mother, taking the child in her arms, thanked him, and said,
"Lord! may you live long!" and went her way.  
 Here ends the case regarding the son.
