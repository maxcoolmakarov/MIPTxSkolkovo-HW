Four blind men went to see an elephant.   
One who touched its leg said, "The elephant is like a pillar."   
The second who touched the trunk said, "The elephant is like a thick club."   
The third touched the belly, and thought it to be like a big jar.   
The fourth who felt the ears, concluded that the elephant was like a winnowing fan.   
They then began to dispute amongst themselves as to the ?gure of the animal they had touched.   
A passer-by hearing them quarrel, said, "What is it this you are disputing about?"   
Then they stated the question and asked him to arbitrate. He said, "Not one of you knows the real elephant. As a whole, it is neither like a pillar, nor a jar, nor a winnowing fan, nor a club. But its legs are like pillars, its belly like a big jar, its ears like a winnowing fan, and its trunk like a thick club. The elephant itself is a combination of all these."   
In exactly the same manner do men quarrel among themselves about religion, each having seen some different aspect of the Deity.
