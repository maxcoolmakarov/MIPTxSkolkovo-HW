The ourisk of the Celts was a creature by no means peculiarly malevolent 
or formidably powerful, but rather a melancholy spirit, which dwelt in 
wildernesses far removed from men. If we are to identify him with the 
Brown Dwarf of the Border moors, the ourisk has a mortal term of life and 
a hope of salvation, as indeed the same high claim was made by the satyr 
who appeared to St. Anthony. Moreover, the Highland ourisk was a species 
of lubber fiend, and capable of being over-reached by those who understood 
philology.   
It is related of one of these goblins which frequented a mill near the 
foot of Loch Lomond, that the miller, desiring to get rid of this meddling 
spirit, who injured the machinery by setting the water on the wheel when 
there was no grain to be grinded, contrived to have a meeting with the 
goblin by watching in his mill till night. The ourisk then entered, and 
demanded the miller's name, and was informed that he was called 
 Myself ; on which is founded a story almost exactly like that of 
 Outis  in  The Odyssey , a tale which, though classic, is by no 
means an elegant or ingenious fiction, but which we are astonished to find 
in an obscure district, and in the Celtic tongue, seeming to argue some 
connection or communication between these remote Highlands of Scotland and 
the readers of Homer in former days, which we cannot account for. After 
all, perhaps, some churchman more learned than his brethren may have 
transferred the legend from Sicily to Duncrune, from the shores of the 
Mediterranean to those of Loch Lomond.
