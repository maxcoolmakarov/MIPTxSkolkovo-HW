Before there were any Indians the Legend People, To-when-an-ung-wa, lived 
in that place. Because they were bad, Coyote turned them all into rocks. 
You can see them in that place now -- some standing in rows, some sitting 
down, some holding onto others. You can see their faces with paint on, 
just as they were before they became rocks.  
The name of that place is Agka-ku-wass-a-wits (red painted faces).
