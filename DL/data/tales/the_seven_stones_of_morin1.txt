Not far from the town of Morin in Neumark there are seven stones standing
together in a field.  They are called simply "the Seven Stones."
According to legend they are seven young men who wantonly moistened their bread and
cheese there in an indecent manner.  As punishment for this wickedness, they were
immediately turned into stones.
