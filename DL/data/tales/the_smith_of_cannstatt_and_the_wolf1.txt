The smith of Cannstatt was going through the woods when a wolf leapt toward him.  His jaws were wide open, as though he wanted to swallow the smith whole. To protect himself, the smith pushed his right hand through the wolf's throat and into his body.  He grabbed his tail and turned the wolf inside out, just like a cobbler does with a shoe.
