Reynard saw a man driving a cart full of fish, which made his mouth
water. So he ran and he ran and he ran till he got far away in front of
the cart and lay down in the road as still as if he were dead. 
 When the man came up to him and saw him lying there dead, as he
thought, he said to himself, "Why, that will make a beautiful red fox
scarf and muff for my wife Ann." 
 And he got down and seized hold of Reynard and threw him into the cart
all along with the fish, and then he went driving on as before. Reynard
began to throw the fish out till there were none left, and then he jumped
out himself without the man noticing it, who drove up to his door and
called out, "Ann, Ann, see what I have brought you." 
 And when his wife came to the door she looked into the cart and said,
"Why there is nothing there."
