After the Lord God had created the world he wandered up and down the Wisper Valley and noticed that he had forgotten one spot. So he threw a handful of earth and stones onto a bare slope, and that was founding of the village of Ried.  
Now the people of Ried were a simple and backward folk.  One day the mayor of Ried was in a village further down in the valley and, for the first time in his life, he saw a donkey. He liked the looks of this beast, and he asked the people how to grow such an animal, for he himself would like to have one.  
They said, "We plant them on a manure pile as little pumpkins.  With sunshine and rain they grow bigger and bigger, and in the summer when the sun is right hot young donkeys hatch out of them, just like little chicks come from eggs. But if you want it to happen more quickly, you have to hatch them yourself."  
With that the mayor purchased a round green pumpkin and carried it back up to his village. He set it in the middle of the village square and he plus two other men sat on it day and night.  After two days others came to relieve them, but while they were changing places the pumpkin rolled away.  It crashed into some brush, frightening a hare, which leapt madly away.  
The mayor ran after it, waving his arms and shouting, "Stop! Stop, little donkey, I'm your father!"
