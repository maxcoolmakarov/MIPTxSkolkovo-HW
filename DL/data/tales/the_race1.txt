Once upon a time there was a tortoise and a rabbit lived in a forest 
together. So the rabbit says to the tortoise, "How slow you walk!" So 
there was a river not far away, where water lilies grew.   
So the tortoise said to the rabbit, "I'll run a race with you." So the 
rabbit laughed at the tortoise. So the rabbit asked where he wanted to run 
a race to.   
The tortoise said, "Down to the river, where the water lilies grew."   
And the rabbit said, "You'll grow old and die before you get there."   
But the turtle said to the rabbit, "Who shall we have for a judge to this 
race?"   
An' the rabbit said, "We'll get Mr. Wolf for a judge."   
So they said, one, two, three, an' away they went. So the rabbit ran right 
fast till he got in sight of the river where the water lilies grew. And he 
lay down in the shade to rest. While he was resting, he fell fast asleep. 
And when he awoke again, it was the next day at dinnertime. So he was very 
hungry; and he ran into a near field an' eat some clover, an' he didn't 
know that the tortoise had passed him while he was asleep. So after he had 
ate his dinner, he ran right fast to the goal. But who should he find when 
he got there, waiting for him, but the tortoise who he had laughed at the 
day before.
