Of the Devil's power and wickedness will I here tell a true history. About 180 years ago, on S. Mary Magdalene's Day, it came to pass at Hammel [Hameln] on the Weser in Saxony, that the Devil went about the streets visibly in human form, piped and allured many children, boys and girls, and led them through the town gate towards a mountain. When he arrived there he disappeared with the numerous children who had followed him, and nobody knew what became of the children.  
Thus did a girl who had followed them afar report to her parents, and thereupon diligent search and inquiry was soon made over  land and water to find out whether the children had possibly been stolen and led away. But nobody could tell what had become of the children. This grieved the parents terribly, and is a fearful example of divine anger against sin.   
This is all written in the town-book of Hammel, where many persons of high standing have read and heard it.
