Once upon a time there was a king who had twelve children, all boys.  He also wanted to have a girl and said to the queen, "If our thirteenth child, which you are soon going to bring to the world, is a girl, then I shall have the twelve others killed, but if it is also a boy, then they may all live together."  The queen tried to dissuade him, but the king would not listen to her.  "If it happens as I said, then they must die.  I would rather strike off their heads myself than to have a girl among them."   
This saddened the queen, for she loved her sons greatly and did not know how to save them.  Finally she went to the youngest one, whom she loved even more than the others, and revealed to him what the king had decided, saying, "Dear child, go out into the forest with your eleven brothers.  Stay there and do not return home.  One of you must keep watch from a tree and look toward the tower here.  If I bring a little son into the world, then I shall fly a white flag from the top of the tower, but if it is a little daughter, then it shall be a red flag.  Then you must save yourselves by fleeing into the world, and may God protect you.  I will get up every night and pray for you, in the cold of winter that you may not freeze and that a warm fire may be burning before you, and in the heat of summer that you may rest and sleep in a cool forest."   
Thus she blessed her children, and they went forth into the forest.  They often looked toward the tower, and one of them always had to sit high in a tall oak tree and keep watch.  Soon a flag was raised, but it was not the white one, but rather the red-blood flag that threatened their destruction.  When the boys saw it they became angry and cried out, "Are we to lose our lives for the sake of a girl!"  Then they swore among themselves to remain in the middle of the forest, and whenever they might happen upon a girl, they would kill her without mercy.   
They found a cave in the darkest part of the forest, and there they lived.  Every morning eleven of them set forth to hunt, but one of them had to stay at home to cook and keep house.  Every girl that the eleven came upon was done away with without mercy.  And so it was for many years.   
The little sister at home grew up as an only child.  One day she discovered twelve men's shirts in the wash.  "Whose shirts are these?" asked the princess.  "They are much too small for my father."  Then the washerwoman told her that she had had twelve brothers who had secretly left home because the king had wanted to have them killed, and no one knew where they now were.  The twelve shirts belonged to these twelve brothers.  The little sister was amazed that she had never heard anything of her twelve brothers.  That afternoon she sat in a meadow bleaching the wash and pondering the words of the washerwoman.  Finally she stood up, took the twelve shirts, and walked into the forest where her brothers lived.  
The little sister came to the cave where they lived.  Eleven were out hunting, and only one of them was at home doing the cooking.  When he saw the girl he grabbed her and reached for his sword, saying, "Kneel down!  Your red blood will flow this instant!"  
"Master, let me live!" she begged.  "I will stay here and serve you well.  I will cook and keep house."  Now this was the youngest brother, and the girl's beauty softened him, and he spared her life.  The eleven returned home and were amazed to find a live girl in their cave.  He said to them, "Brothers, this girl came to our cave.  I was about to strike her down, but she begged so fervently for her life, and agreed to serve us faithfully and to keep house for us, so I spared her."  The others agreed that this was to their advantage, and that now all twelve would be able to go out hunting, and they were satisfied.  Then she showed them the twelve shirts and said that she was their sister.  They rejoiced and were happy that they had not killed her.  
The little sister took over the household.  While the brothers were out hunting, she gathered wood and herbs, tended the fire, made the clean, white beds, and did everything eagerly and well.  One day it happened that when she was finished with her work she went for a walk in the woods.  She came to a place where there were twelve tall white lilies, and because she liked them so much, she plucked them all.  This had scarcely happened when an old woman appeared before her.  "Oh, my daughter," she said.  "Why didn't you leave the twelve flowers standing?  They are your twelve brothers, who have now been transformed into ravens and are lost forever."  
The little sister began to cry.  "Oh!" she said.  "Is there no way to redeem them?"  
"No, there is only one way in the world, and it is so difficult that you will never succeed.  You must remain silent for twelve whole years.  If you speak a single word, even if all but one hour has passed, then it will all be for nothing, and your brothers will die that instant."  
The little sister took a seat high in a tall tree in the forest where she would spin in silence for twelve years and thus redeem her brothers.  One day a king was hunting in this forest.  His dog stopped at the tree and barked.  The king halted, looked up, and was amazed at the princess's beauty.  He called to her, asking her if she would become his wife.  She remained silent, but nodded a little with her head.  The king himself climbed up and lifted her down, set her before him on his horse, and took her home to his castle, where their wedding was celebrated with splendor.  The princess never spoke a word, and the king thought that she was a mute.  
They would have lived happily together if it had not been for the king's mother, who began to slander her to him, "You have brought home a common beggar girl, and behind your back she is doing the most unspeakable things."   
Because the queen could not defend herself, the king was led into believing his mother, and finally he had his wife sentenced to death.  A large fire was set in the courtyard where she was to be burned to death.  She was already standing in the fire, with the flames jumping at her dress when the last minutes of the twelve years elapsed.  There was a rushing sound in the air, and twelve ravens came flying down and landed.  When they touched the earth they turned into twelve handsome princes, who scattered the fire about, and pulled out their sister.  Then she spoke once again, telling the king everything, how she had had to redeem her twelve brothers, and they all rejoiced that everything turned out so well.  
But what should they do with the wicked stepmother?  She was thrown into a barrel filled with boiling oil and poisonous snakes, and died a miserable death.
