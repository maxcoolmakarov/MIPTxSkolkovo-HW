In JÃ¼terbog a wooden cudgel, several feet in length, hangs from
town gate. Beneath it is fastened a tablet upon which is written the
following: 
 
 
 
 Wer seinen Kindern gibt das Brot 
Und leidet nachher selber Not, 
Den schlag' man mit dieser Keule tot. 
 
 He who gives his children bread 
And afterwards himself suffers need, 
With this cudgel shall be struck dead. 
 
 
 
 About this it is told that there was once a rich man who had three
sons. During his lifetime he gave them all his wealth, but afterward he
himself suffered need, for not one of his children would support him. 
 After he died, his children quickly appeared at court to see if there
was not something else for them to inherit, but they found nothing but a
large, heavy chest. Opening it, they found that it was filled with stones,
beneath which were the cudgel, the tablet, and instructions that both
should be hung from the town gate. And so it was done.
