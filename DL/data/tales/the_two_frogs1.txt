Once upon a time in the country of Japan there lived two frogs, one of 
whom made his home in a ditch near the town of Osaka, on the sea coast, 
while the other dwelt in a clear little stream which ran through the city 
of Kyoto.  At such a great distance apart, they had never even heard of 
each other; but, funnily enough, the idea came into both their heads at 
once that they should like to see a little of the world, and the frog who 
lived at Kyoto wanted to visit Osaka, and the frog who lived at Osaka 
wished to go to Kyoto, where the great Mikado had his palace. 
So one fine morning in the spring they both set out along the road that 
led from Kyoto to Osaka, one from one end and the other from the other.  
The journey was more tiring than they expected, for they did not know 
much about traveling, and halfway between the two towns there arose a 
mountain which had to be climbed.  It took them a long time and a great 
many hops to reach the top, but there they were at last, and what was the 
surprise of each to see another frog before him!   
They looked at each other for a moment without speaking, and then fell 
into conversation, explaining the cause of their meeting so far from 
their homes.  It was delightful to find that they both felt the same 
wish--to learn a little more of their native country--and as there was no 
sort of hurry they stretched themselves out in a cool, damp place, and 
agreed that they would have a good rest before they parted to go their 
ways. 
"What a pity we are not bigger," said the Osaka frog; "for then we could 
see both towns from here, and tell if it is worth our while going on." 
"Oh, that is easily managed," returned the Kyoto frog.  "We have only got 
to stand up on our hind legs, and hold onto each other, and then we can 
each look at the town he is traveling to." 
This idea pleased the Osaka frog so much that he at once jumped up and 
put his front paws on the shoulder of his friend, who had risen also.  
There they both stood, stretching themselves as high as they could, and 
holding each other tightly, so that they might not fall down.  The Kyoto 
frog turned his nose towards Osaka, and the Osaka frog turned his nose 
towards Kyoto; but the foolish things forgot that when they stood up 
their great eyes lay in the backs of their heads, and that though their 
noses might point to the places to which they wanted to go, their eyes 
beheld the places from which they had come. 
"Dear me!" cried the Osaka frog, "Kyoto is exactly like Osaka.  It is 
certainly not worth such a long journey.  I shall go home!" 
"If I had had any idea that Osaka was only a copy of Kyoto I should never 
have traveled all this way," exclaimed the frog from Kyoto, and as he 
spoke he took his hands from his friend's shoulders, and they both fell 
down on the grass.  Then they took a polite farewell of each other, and 
set off for home again, and to the end of their lives they believed that 
Osaka and Kyoto, which are as different to look at as two towns can be, 
were as alike as two peas.
