One day when a monkey was climbing a tree in the forest in which he
lived, he ran a thorn into his tail. Try as he would, he could not get it
out, so he went to a barber in the town and said, "Friend barber, I have a
thorn in the end of my tail. Pull it out, and I will pay you well." 
 The barber tried to pull out the thorn with his razor, but in doing so
he cut off the end of the tail. 
 The monkey was very angry and cried, "Barber, barber, give me back my
tail, or give me your razor!" 
 The barber could not put back the end of the monkey's tail, so he gave
him his razor. 
 On the way home the monkey met an old woman who was cutting wood for
fuel, and he said to her, "Grandmother, grandmother, that is very hard.
Use this razor and then it will cut easily." 
 The old woman was very pleased with the offer and began to cut with the
razor, but before she had used it long it broke. 
 Then the monkey cried, "Grandmother, grandmother, you have broken my
razor! You must get a new one for me or else give me all the
firewood." 
 The old woman could not get a new razor, so she gave him the
firewood. 
 The monkey took the wood and was going back to town to sell it, when he
saw a woman sitting beside the road making cakes. 
 "Grandmother, grandmother," said he, "your wood is most gone. Take this
of mine and bake more cakes." 
 The woman took the wood and thanked him for his kindness, but when the
last stick was burned, the monkey cried out, "Grandmother, grandmother,
you have burned up all my wood! Now you must give me all your cakes to pay
for it." 
 The old woman could not cut more dry wood at once, so she gave him all
the cakes. The monkey took the cakes and the town, but on the way he met a
dog which bit him so that he died. And the dog ate all the cakes.
