A witch rescues a man, who was going to gaol, and plagues the bailiffs, by leading them a dance over hedge and ditch.    
 
A poor man, being arrested by a cruel creditor for debt, and he not being able to pay it, they were carrying him to Lancaster Gaol, when Mother Cuthbert met them, and desired to know the matter.  
The officers answered her very surlily, pushing her aside, which, raising her choler, she said, "But you shall let him go before we do part."  
And they said he should not.  
Whereupon she bade the poor man stop his ears close; and then she drew out a pipe which had been given her by the Witch of Penmure, and then set piping, and led them through hedges and thorns, over ditches, banks, and poles, sometimes tumbling, and other times tearing and bruising their flesh, while the poor fellow got time enough to make his escape; but the catchpoles cried out for mercy, thinking the devil had led them a dance.  
At length she left them in the middle of a stinking pond, to shift for themselves.
