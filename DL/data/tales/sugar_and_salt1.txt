Once upon a time there was a father who had two daughters. Calling them
to him one day he said to them, "What is the sweetest thing in the world?"
 "Sugar," said the elder daughter.
 "Salt," said the younger.
 The father was angry at this last answer. But his daughter stuck to it,
and so her father said to her, "I won't keep a daughter in my house who
believes that salt is the sweetest thing in the world. You must leave me
and seek another home."
 So the younger daughter left her father's house and wandered here and
there, suffering much hunger and cold, until t last she was befriended by
the fairies. As she walked through a wood one day listening to the songs
of the birds, a prince came hunting for deer, and when he saw her he fell
in love with her at once. She agreed to marry him, and a great banquet was
prepared at the prince's house. To this banquet the bride's father was
bidden; but he did not know that the bride was his own daughter.
 Now, at the wish of the bride, all the dishes were prepared without
salt. So when the guests began to eat they found that the food was
tasteless. At last one of them said, "There is no salt in the meat!"
 And then all the guests said, "There is no salt in the meat!"
 And the bride's father spoke the loudest of all. "Truly, salt is the
sweetest thing in the world," he said, "though, for saying so, I sent my
own daughter away from my house, and shall never see her face again."
 Then the bride made herself known to her father, and fell on his neck
and kissed him.
