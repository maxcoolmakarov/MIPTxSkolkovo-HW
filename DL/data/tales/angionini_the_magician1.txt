They tell the following legend in the village of Drancy-les-Nouis near Paris:
In the year 1240 there was such a quantity of rats and mice that neither home nor field and neither humans nor cattle were safe from their voracious appetite. Nothing was effective against them. Finally it occurred to the townspeople to engage a Capuchin by the name of Friar Angionini, famous for his magic, and who might drive away the vermin with his miraculous powers.  
Soon afterward both parties agreed upon a certain reward.  Thereupon the magician took a little demon from his bag, with whom he performed all kinds of hocus pocus. Then he took out a little book from which he read a number of incomprehensible charms. Finally he commanded all the rats and mice to gather around him.  
Behold, countless rats and mice obeyed and came forth immediately, awaiting his further orders. He then turned around and walked to the bank of the river. Throwing off his robe, he jumped into the waves. The entire pack of rodents followed him and drowned.  
Having achieved this miracle, the deserving Capuchin returned and demanded his money. However, the unthankful townspeople refused to pay.   
The wise man then took from his bag a small horn and blew into it. Immediately all the cows, hogs, sheep, horses, goats, geese, and ducks came forth and gathered around Friar Angionini. This time the wise friar did not advance toward the river but went off in the other direction with all of his spellbound followers.  
No one dared to challenge him.  
Thus is thanklessness rewarded!
