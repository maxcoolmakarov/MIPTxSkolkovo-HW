Once upon a time a widow sent her daughter to a well called the ''well of the world's end'' for a bucket of water as she wanted to make an oat meal cake. The girl took the bucket, but when she came to the well it was empty.  
A frog which was near the well told her that he would fill the well if she promised to marry him. After the girl had promised to marry him, the frog jumped into the well and in a minute the well was full of water.  
The girl filled her bucket and went home.  
On the following night the frog came to the girl's house and asked her to cut of his head. The girl did so, and a beautiful prince stood before her. The girl and the prince were married soon after.
