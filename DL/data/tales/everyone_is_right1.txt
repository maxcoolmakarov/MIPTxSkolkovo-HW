Once when Nasreddin Hodja was serving as qadi, one of his neighbors 
came to him with a complaint against a fellow neighbor.  
 The Hodja listened to the charges carefully, then concluded, "Yes, dear 
neighbor, you are quite right."  
 Then the other neighbor came to him. The Hodja listened to his defense 
carefully, then concluded, "Yes, dear neighbor, you are quite right."  
 The Hodja's wife, having listened in on the entire proceeding, said to 
him, "Husband, both men cannot be right."  
 The Hodja answered, "Yes, dear wife, you are quite right."
