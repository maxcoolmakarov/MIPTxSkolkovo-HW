Master Hobson had a daughter which was a very fair and young woman, the which for her husband that lay a-dying, made great sorrow and lamentation, and would not be comforted by any persuasions, wherefore her father came to her and said, "Daughter, leave of your mourning, for if God take away your husband, I will speedily provide you another of as great a wealth and credit as he is now of, and far more young and lusty."  
But yet for all this would she not leave mourning, and grew greatly displeased that her father made any motion of another husband, protesting that she would never marry more.  
But now mark the variable minds of women; her husband was no sooner dead and buried, the charges of his burial paid for, and she with her friends set at supper to comfort her, between sobbing and weeping, she whispered her father in the care and said, "Father, where is the same man, that ye said should bee my husband?"  
"Thus may you see, quoth Mister Hobson, "the nature of women-kind, and how long they mourn for their husbands after they be dead."  
These words made the young woman never after to ask her father for a husband.
