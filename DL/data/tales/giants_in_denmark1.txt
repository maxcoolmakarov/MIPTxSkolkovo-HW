That the country of Denmark was once cultivated and worked by giants, is 
attested by the enormous stones attached to the barrows and caves of the 
ancients.  Should any man question that this is accomplished by 
superhuman force, let him look up at the tops of certain mountains and 
say, if he knows, what man has carried such immense boulders up to their 
crests. 
For anyone considering this marvel will mark that it is inconceivable how 
a mass, hardly at all or but with difficulty movable upon a level, could 
have been raised to so mighty a peak of so lofty a mountain by mere human 
effort, or by the ordinary exertion of human strength.  But as to 
whether, after the deluge went forth, there existed giants who could do 
such deeds, or men endowed beyond others with bodily force, there is 
scant tradition to tell us. 
But, as our countrymen assert, even today there are those who dwell in 
that rugged and inaccessible region to the north who, by the 
transformable nature of their bodies, are granted the power of being near 
or distant, and of appearing and vanishing in turn.  The approach to this 
region, whose position and name are unknown, and which lacks all 
civilization, but teems with peoples of monstrous strangeness, is beset 
with perils of a fearful kind, and has seldom granted to those who 
attempted it an unscathed return.
