Laurence Farker was a highly nervous man. He suffered from innumerable maladies, and was often unable either to go to the fishing, or lend a hand at working the croft. This annoyed his better half considerably. She did not sympathise with her husband in the least, for she believed, and perhaps not without some reason, that his ills were more imaginary than real.   
One morning Laurence found that he was quite unable to go to the fishing with the other men. He lay in bed all that day, and his wife went about her manifold duties, and paid very little attention to him. At nightfall she titied up the house and went to visit a neighbour, and Laurence was left alone.   
He was lying bemoaning his unhappy lot, when he perceived a number of little folks come trooping in over the floor. One of them carried a  stone pig  (earthenware bottle) in his hand. The trows, for such Laurence knew them to be, seated themselves on the hearth round the blazing peat fire. After a little, one of them spoke.   
"The guidman is no weel," said he.   
"No," remarked another, "but if he had somethin' oot o' wir pig, dat wid better him."   
A short silence followed, and the listener waited eagerly.   
"His wife is not guid til him," said the first speaker; "she'll be comin' back, so we had better go."   
With this they got up in a body and made for the door, but when they were opposite the bed, Laurence cried out, "Loard surround me, an' sae da pig!"   
The trows immediately vanished, but the pig was left behind.   
Laurence recollected what the trow had said. He took "somethin' oot o' da pig," and after a few doses all his ills departed. The fame of that pig went far and wide. Its contents never grew less, and proved a never-failing cure for all diseases.
