Fairy 
  
My grandmother used to tell a story about a mill-goblin somewhere up in 
the country, where no one could get anything ground at the mill, it was so 
bewitched. But one evening came a beggar-woman, who badly wanted to get a 
little corn ground, and she asked if she could not get leave to stay there 
for the night and do it.   
"Oh, dear no!" said the owner of the mill; "you can't stay there at night; 
neither you nor the mill would have any peace for the goblin."   
But the beggar-woman wanted so badly to get her corn ground, for she had 
not a spoonful of meal to make either soup or porridge for the children at 
home. Well, at last she got leave to go into the mill and grind her corn 
at night. When she came there, she made a fire on the hearth, where a big 
pot of tar was hanging. She started the mill, and sat down by the hearth 
with her knitting.   
In a while a girl came into the mill and said "Good evening" to her.   
"Good evening," answered the beggar-woman, and went on with her knitting. 
  
But very soon the strange girl began raking the fire out over the hearth, 
but the beggar-woman raked it together again.   
"What's your name?: said the fairy, as you already will have guessed that 
the strange girl was.   
"My name is Self!" answered the beggar-woman.   
"The girl thought that was a strange name, and began raking the fire about 
again. This made the beggar-woman angry, and she began scolding and raking 
the fire together. They were thus employed for some time, when the 
beggar-woman, watching her opportunity, upset the boiling tar over the 
girl, who began screaming and screeching, and as she ran out of the mill, 
she cried, "Father, father, Self has burnt me!"   
"Well, if you have burnt yourself, you have only yourself to blame," said 
a voice in the hill.
