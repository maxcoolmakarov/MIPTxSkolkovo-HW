An old woman became almost totally blind from a disease of the eyes, and, 
after consulting a doctor, made an agreement 

with him in the presence of witnesses that she should pay him a high fee 
if he cured her, while if he failed he was to 

receive nothing. The doctor accordingly prescribed a course of treatment, 
and every time he paid her a visit he took 

away with him some article out of the house, until at last, when he 
visited her for the last time, and the cure was 

complete, there was nothing left.    
When the old woman saw that the house was empty she refused to pay him his 
fee; and, after repeated refusals on her 

part, he sued her before the magistrates for payment of her debt. On being 
brought into court she was ready with her 

defense. "The claimant," said she, "has stated the facts about our 
agreement correctly. I undertook to pay him a fee 

if he cured me, and he, on his part, promised to charge nothing if he 
failed. Now, he says I am cured. But I say that 

I am blinder than ever, and I can prove what I say. When my eyes were bad 
I could at any rate see well enough to be 

aware that my house contained a certain amount of furniture and other 
things. But now, when according to him I am 

cured, I am entirely unable to see anything there at all."
