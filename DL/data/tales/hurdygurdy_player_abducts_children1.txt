A man with a hurdy-gurdy once came to Brandenburg. He played and
played, and such wonderful tones came out of his music box that all the
city's children followed after him in a great swarm. He went out the gate
to Marienberg (Mary's Mountain). It opened up and the man went inside with
all the children. They were never seen again.
