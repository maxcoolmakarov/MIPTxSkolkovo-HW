In the village of Auer there is a monument, the so-called plague column, which they had built in thanks for their liberation from the Black Death. Mysterious things often happen here, especially in the nights of the Ember Days. Large, dark masses roll moaning and groaning across the street or follow after the passers-by. Furthermore, other sinister beings are often seen next to the plague column. Once a headless giant attacked someone there.
