At the time when there were still elves in and around Brotterode, they often gave aid to those who knew how to deal with them. But they were terribly sensitive. If they were offended they immediately disappeared.  
Once a pair of elves found their way into a grinding-mill near Brotterode, at a place still today called "The Grindstone." Two brothers owned the mill, and however many blades they laid out each evening to be ground and polished, the next morning they were all perfectly finished. This continued for a long time, and the elve's hardworking hands brought them great prosperity.  
They wanted to thank their little helpers. Having noticed that the elves were very poorly dressed, they had little red jackets and little blue trousers tailored for them, and laid them out next to the blades in the grinding area.  
The industrious house-sprites soon appeared, ready to work. However, when they saw the clothes they became very sad, saying: 

 
 
 
  
Da liegt nun unser Lohn,  
Jetzt m√ºssen wir auf und davon!  
 
 
Now that we've received our pay,   
We must up and go away!  
 
 
   

They picked up the gifts, went away, and were never seen there again.
