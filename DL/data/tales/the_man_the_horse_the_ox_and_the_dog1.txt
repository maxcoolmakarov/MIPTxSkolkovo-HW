One winter's day during a severe storm a horse, an ox, and a dog came and 
begged for shelter in the house of a man. He 

readily admitted them, and, as they were cold and wet, he lit a fire for 
their comfort; and he put oats before the 

horse, and hay before the ox, while he fed the dog with the remains of his 
own dinner. When the storm abated, and they 

were about to depart, they determined to show their gratitude in the 
following way. They divided the life of man among 

them, and each endowed one part of it with the qualities which were 
peculiarly his own. The horse took youth, and 

hence young men are high-mettled and impatient of restraint; the ox took 
middle age, and accordingly men in middle 

life are steady and hard-working; while the dog took old age, which is the 
reason why old men are so often peevish and 

ill-tempered, and, like dogs, attached chiefly to those who look to their 
comfort, while they are disposed to snap at 

those who are unfamiliar or distasteful to them.
