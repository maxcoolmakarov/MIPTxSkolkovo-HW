Long, long ago, in the days when there were giants in the land, two of them were turned out by the rest and forced to go and live by themselves, so they set to work to build themselves a hill to live in. In a very short time they had dug out the earth from the bed of the Severn, which runs in the trench they made to the present time, and with it they piled up the Wrekin, intending to make it their home. 
  
Those bare patches on the turf, between the Bladderstone and the top of the hill, are the marks of their feet, where from that day to this the grass has never grown. But they had not been there long before they quarrelled, and one of them struck at the other with his spade, but failed to hit him, and the spade descending to the ground cleft the solid rock and made the "Needle's Eye." 
  
Then they began to fight, and the giant with the spade (for they seem to have had only one between them -- perhaps that was what they quarrelled about!) was getting the best of it at first, but a raven flew up and pecked at his eyes, and the pain made him shed such a mighty tear that it hollowed out the little basin in the rock which we call the Raven's Bowl, or sometimes the Cuckoo's Cup, which has never been dry since, but is always full of water even in the hottest summers. 
  
And now you may suppose that it was very easy for the other giant to master the one who had the spade, and when he had done so, he determined to put him where he could never trouble anyone again. So he very quickly built up the Ercall Hill beside the Wrekin, and imprisoned his fallen foe within it. There the poor blind giant remains until this day, and in the dead of night you may sometimes hear him groaning.
 
There is another and a better-known legend of this famous Wreken: 
  

Once upon a time there was a wicked old giant in Wales who, for some 
reason or other, had a very great spite against the Mayor of Shrewsbury 
and all his people, and he made up his mind to dam up the Severn, and by 
that means cause such a flood that the town would be drowned.   
So off he set, carrying a spadeful of earth, and tramped along mile after 
mile trying to find the way to Shrewsbury. And how he missed it I cannot 
tell, but he must have gone wrong somewhere, for at last he got close to 
Wellington, and by that time he was puffing and blowing under his heavy 
load, and wishing he was at the end of his journey. By and by there came a 
cobbler along the road with a sack of old boots and shoes on his back, for 
he lived at Wellington, and went once a fortnight to Shrewsbury to collect 
his customers' old boots and shoes, and take them home with him to mend. 
  
And the giant called out to him. "I say," he said, "how far is it to 
Shrewsbury?"   
"Shrewsbury?" said the cobbler; "what do you want at Shrewsbury?"   
"Why," said the giant, "to fill up the Severn with this lump of earth I've 
got here. I've an old grudge against the mayor and the folks at 
Shrewsbury, and now I mean to drown them out, and get rid of them all at 
once."   
"My word!" thought the cobbler. "This'll never do! I can't afford to lose 
my customers!" And he spoke up again. "Eh!" he said, "you'll never get to 
Shrewsbury -- not today  nor   tomorrow. Why look at me! I'm just 
come from Shrewsbury, and I've had time to wear out all these old boots 
and shoes on the road since I started." And he showed him his sack.   
"Oh!" said the giant, with a great groan. "Then it's no use! I'm fairly 
tired out already, and I can't carry this load of mine any farther. I 
shall just drop it here and go back home."   
So he dropped the earth on the ground just where he stood, and scraped his 
boots on the spade, and off he went home again to Wales, and nobody ever 
heard anything of him in Shropshire after. But where he put down his load, 
there stands the Wrekin to this day; and even the earth that he scraped 
off his boots was such a pile that it made the little Ercall by the 
Wrekin's side.
