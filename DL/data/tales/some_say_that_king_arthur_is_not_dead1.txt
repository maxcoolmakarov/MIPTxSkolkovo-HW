Some men say in many parts of England that King Arthur is not dead, but had by the will of our Lord Jesu into another place; and men say that he shall come again, and he shall win the holy cross. I will not say it shall be so, but rather I will say: here in this world he changed his life. But many men say that there is written upon his tomb this verse:  
 
 Hic jacet Arthurus, Rex quondam, Rexque futurus. 
[Here lies Arthur, the once and future king.]
