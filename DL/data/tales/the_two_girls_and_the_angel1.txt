A young girl wanted to go into the woods and look for strawberries. Her mother gave her permission and provided her with cabbage and bacon to take along. Arriving at the gate, the girl saw an angel sitting there who asked for something to eat. Without hesitating, the girl gave the angel everything that her mother had sent with her, then happily went further into the woods and picked a basketful of strawberries.  
Upon leaving the woods on her way home, the girl again saw the angel, who asked for a few strawberries. The girl gladly gave them to the angel.  
Then the angel said, "When you come to the gate you will see a box. Take this with you, but do not open it until you arrive home."  
No -- she would not open it.  
Arriving at the gate she found the box, quickly took it home to her mother, and then opened it. It was filled with precious stones and gold coins. Thus the girl suddenly had become very wealthy.  
Another girl heard about this and wanted to go into the woods and look for strawberries as well. Her mother also gave her cabbage and bacon to take along.  
When she came to the gate, the angel was sitting there and asked, "Give me a little of your cabbage and bacon."  
The girl answered, "You can eat dirt!"  
She went further into the woods and picked a basketful of strawberries.  
Leaving the woods she saw the same angel, who asked, "Give me a few strawberries."  
The girl said, "I'm going to eat the strawberries myself," and gave nothing to the angel, who then replied, "Just be on your way! At the gate you will find a box. You may take it with you, but do not open it until you arrive at home."  
Oh, how the girl ran until she came to the gate and found the box! She was beside herself with joy. Arriving at home she opened the box -- and what was inside? Nothing but little black devils.
