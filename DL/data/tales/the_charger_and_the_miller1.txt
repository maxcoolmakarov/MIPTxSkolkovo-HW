A horse who had been used to carry his rider into battle felt himself 
growing old and chose to work in a mill instead. 

He now no longer found himself stepping out proudly to the beating of the 
drums, but was compelled to slave away all 

day grinding the corn. Bewailing his hard lot, he said one day to the 
miller, "Ah me! I was once a splendid war horse 

gaily caparisoned, and attended by a groom whose sole duty was to see to 
my wants. How different is my present 

condition! I wish I had never given up the battlefield for the mill." The 
miller replied with asperity, "It's no use 

your regretting the past. Fortune has many ups and downs. You must just 
take them as they come."
