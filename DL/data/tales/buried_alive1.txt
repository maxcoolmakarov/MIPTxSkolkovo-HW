Many years ago an epidemic swept over Dalland, to which thousands of
persons fell victims. Many people fled to the forests, or to other
regions. The churches were deserted, and those remaining were not enough
to bury the dead. At this stage an old Finlander came along, who informed
the few survivors that they need not hope for cessation of the scourge
until they had buried some living thing. 
 The advice was followed. First a cock was buried alive, but the plague
continued as violent as ever. Next, a goat, but this also proved
ineffectual. At last a poor boy, who frequented the neighborhood, begging,
was lured to a wood-covered hill at the point where the river Daleborg
empties into Lake Venem. Here a deep hole was dug, the boy meantime
sitting near, enjoying a piece of bread and butter that had been given
him. 
 When the grave was deep enough, the boy was dropped into it and the
diggers began hurriedly to shovel the dirt upon him. The lad begged and
prayed them not to throw dirt upon his bread and butter, but the spades
flew faster, and in a few minutes, still alive, he was entirely covered
and left to his fate. 
 Whether this stayed the plague is not know, but many who after night
pass the hill, hear, it is said, a voice as if from a dying child, crying,
"Buried alive! Buried Alive!"
