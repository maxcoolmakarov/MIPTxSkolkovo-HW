Because of its fertility, many Easterners were attracted in former times to Paradise Valley in northern Idaho. An old-timer liked to show to visitors the enormous pumpkins which were grown there; and when asked what they were, he answered  "Why, them's hoss eggs. Never seen any afore?"  
 A little later he would stagger around with an un usually huge pumpkin and pretend to stumble and drop it; whereupon it would roll down a hill and start up a rabbit from a colony at the foot of the hill; for the pumpkin would hit a stone and explode with an awful bang.  
One Easterner, seeing a rabbit bounding off at full speed, cried excitedly: "Well, by gum, that egg would certainly have made some racehorse!"
