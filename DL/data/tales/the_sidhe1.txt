As to their food, they will use common things left 
for them on the hearth or outside the threshold, 
cold potatoes it may be, or a cup of water or of 
milk. But for their feasts they choose the best of 
all sorts, taking it from the solid world, leaving 
some worthless likeness in its place; when they 
rob the potatoes from the ridges the diggers find 
but rottenness and decay; they take the strength 
from the meat in the pot, so that when put on the 
plates it does not nourish. They will not touch 
salt; there is danger to them in it. They will go 
to good cellars to bring away the wine.
