There was once a poor man, who lived in a house next to a wealthy
merchant who sold oil and honey.  As the merchant was a kind neighbor, he
one day sent a flask of oil to the poor man.  The poor man was delighted,
and put it carefully away on the top shelf. 
 One evening, as he was gazing at it, he said half aloud, "I wonder how
much oil there is in that bottle.  There is a large quantity.  If I should
sell it, I could buy five sheep.  Every year I should have lambs, and
before long I should own a flock.  Then I should sell some of the sheep,
and be rich enough to marry a wife.  Perhaps we might have a son.  And
what a fine boy he would be!  So tall, strong, and obedient!  But if he
should disobey me," and he raised the staff which he held in his hand, "I
should punish him thus!" 
 And he swung the staff over his head and brought it heavily to the
ground, knocking, as he did so, the flask off the shelf so that the oil
ran over him from head to foot.
