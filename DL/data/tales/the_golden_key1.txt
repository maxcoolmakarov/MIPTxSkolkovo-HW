Once in the wintertime when the snow was very deep, a poor boy had to
go out and fetch wood on a sled. After he had gathered it together and
loaded it, he did not want to go straight home, because he was so frozen,
but instead to make a fire and warm himself a little first. So he scraped
the snow away, and while he was thus clearing the ground he found a small
golden key. Now he believed that where there was a key, there must also be
a lock, so he dug in the ground and found a little iron chest. "If only
the key fits!" he thought. "Certainly there are valuable things in the
chest." He looked, but there was no keyhole. Finally he found one, but so
small that it could scarcely be seen. He tried the key, and fortunately it
fitted. Then he turned it once, and now we must wait until he has finished
unlocking it and has opened the lid. Then we shall find out what kind of
wonderful things there were in the little chest.
