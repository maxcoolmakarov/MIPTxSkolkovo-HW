A peasant left a jug of milk with a neighbor for safekeeping. When he
reclaimed the jug, the milk had disappeared. Angry words led to a lawsuit,
and the judge decreed that the neighbor should pay for the milk, even
though the latter claimed that the flies had consumed it. 
 "You should have struck them dead," said the judge. 
 "What?" replied the peasant, "You grant me permission to kill
flies?" 
 "Yes indeed," responded the judge. "You have my permission to kill them
anywhere you find them." 
 In that moment the peasant saw a fly on the judge's cheek. He stepped
up to him and gave him a slap, saying, "I bet that cursed fly is one of
those who drank up the milk!" 
 Because of the permission he had granted the peasant, the judge could
do nothing about the slap.
