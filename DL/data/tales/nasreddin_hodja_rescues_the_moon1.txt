One day the Hodja went to the well to draw some water. There he saw the 
moon's reflection. Thinking it fallen into the well, he said, "I will have 
to pull it out immediately." He took a rope with a hook fastened to one 
end and lowered it into the well.   
The hook caught on a rock, and the rope broke, causing the Hodja to fall 
onto his back. Lying there he saw the moon in the heaven and cried out, 
"Praise and honor Allah! I injured myself, but at least the moon is back 
where it belongs."
