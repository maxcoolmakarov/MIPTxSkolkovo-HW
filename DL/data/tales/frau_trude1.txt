Once upon a time there was a small girl who was strong willed and forward, and whenever her parents said anything to her, she disobeyed them.  How could anything go well with her?  
One day she said to her parents: "I have heard so much about Frau Trude. Someday I want to go to her place.  People say such amazing things are seen there, and such strange things happen there, that I have become very curious.  
Her parents strictly forbade her, saying: "Frau Trude is a wicked woman who commits godless acts.  If you go there, you will no longer be our child.  
But the girl paid no attention to her parents and went to Frau Trude's place anyway.  
When she arrived there, Frau Trude asked: "Why are you so pale?"  
"Oh," she answered, trembling all over, "I saw something that frightened me." 
"What did you see?"  
"I saw a black man on your steps."  
"That was a charcoal burner."  
"Then I saw a green man."  
"That was a huntsman."  
"Then I saw a blood-red man."  
"That was a butcher."  
"Oh, Frau Trude, it frightened me when I looked through your window and could not see you, but instead saw the devil with a head of fire."  
"Aha!" she said.  "So you saw the witch properly outfitted.  I have been waiting for you and wanting you for a long time.  Light the way for me now!"  
With that she turned the girl into a block of wood and threw it into the fire.  When it was thoroughly aglow Frau Trude sat down next to it, and warmed herself by it, saying: "It gives such a bright light!"
