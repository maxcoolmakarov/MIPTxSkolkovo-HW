Death promised a man that he would not take him without first
sending messengers. The man's youth soon passed and he became miserable.
One day Death arrived, but the man refused to follow him, because the
promised messengers had not yet appeared. Death responded: "Have you not
been sick? Have you not experienced dizziness, ringing in your ears,
toothache, and blurred vision? These were my messengers." The man, at last
recognizing the truth, quietly yielded and went away.
