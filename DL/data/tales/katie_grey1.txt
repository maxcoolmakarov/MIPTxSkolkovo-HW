There were once upon a time a man and a woman who agreed so well together 
that a harsh word had never passed between them since the beginning of 
their married life; for whatever the husband did the wife thought right 
and proper, and everything that she did the husband thought the best that 
could be done. They had not much to manage with, so they had to be very 
careful, even with the crumbs. But no matter how black things looked, they 
were always happy and contented.     
But envy seems to find her way into every corner, be it ever so humble, 
and if there is no one else who begrudges people living in peace, Old Nick 
[the devil] always tries to get his foot inside. So he lay in wait outside 
their house, wondering how he should be able sow ever so little dissension 
there.     
He tried in one way, and he tried in another, and he tried in every way; 
but although he was always hovering about the house, they kept so well 
together that he could not find a single chink through which he could slip 
in, however small he made himself.     
But what Old Nick himself cannot accomplish, wicked women may manage. In 
the same neighborhood there lived one called Katie Grey who was one of the 
right sort. To her he went, and asked if she could set the old couple 
against each other.     
That wouldn't be very difficult, she thought; and if only he would give 
her a new jacket and petticoat with red and green and blue stripes she 
would be sure to manage it so that Old Nick himself should not be able to 
do it better. Well, Old Nick agreed to that, and so they parted.     
Early next morning, as soon as the husband had set out for the forest, 
Katie Grey rushed off to see the wife.     
"Good morning, and well met!" she said, making herself as pleasant as 
possible.     
"Good morning!" said the wife.     
"You have a very good husband, you have, haven't you?" said Katie Grey.   
  
"Yes, the Lord be praised!" said the wife. "When the first snow falls this 
autumn it will be six and thirty years since we were married, and never 
during all these years has a single harsh word fallen from his lips."   
  
Katie Grey quite agreed with her, as you may guess. "Yes, he is no doubt 
one of the best men one can meet in a day's walk," she said. But I know 
people who have got on just as well as you two, and yet trouble came in 
the end."     
"Poor people!" said the wife. "But just as soon will the mouse lie down 
with the cat, as such things will be heard about us," she said.     
Well, that might be. Katie Grey was not one to believe all that people 
said, but "better wise beforehand than hasty afterwards," and "those who 
remedies know, can well kill illness, I trow." And as she knew of a remedy 
against such a misfortune, she thought she ought to mention it, for when 
they had lived together like a pair of turtledoves for six and thirty 
years it would be both "sin and shame" if they were now to begin to bicker 
and quarrel.     
The wife could not say anything to that.     
"Well, you see," said Katie Grey, for now she thought she had got the 
better of the wife, "if you take a razor and draw it three times along a 
strop against the sun, and then cut off six hairs from your husband's 
beard just under his chin one night when he is asleep, and afterwards burn 
them, he will never he angry with you."     
The wife said she did not think she would ever be in need of that remedy, 
but she thanked her for her good advice all the same.     
Katie Grey then set out for the forest, where the husband was making osier 
bands.     
"Good morning, and well met!" she said.     
"Good morning to you!" said the man.     
"What a very kind and good wife you have got!" she said.     
"That's true enough," said the man. "There isn't a better woman on this 
side of the sun, nor has there ever been one either."     
"That may be," said Katie Grey, "but so was Eve also before the Evil One 
got the better of her."     
"Yes, that's true; but my wife, you see, is not one of that sort, for she 
never puts her foot where such wickedness is going on," he said.     
"Don't be so sure about that, for the Evil One can creep through the eye 
of a needle," she said, "so that no one is secure against him. Not that I 
want make any mischief between people -- no one can say that about me -- 
but those who will run into danger had better be well looked after. 'All 
is not gold that glitters,' and 'outside mild, inside wild,' often go 
together," she said.     
"You talk according to the sense you have," said the man, who began to 
feel angry. "My wife is no more likely to wish me evil than the sun to 
shine in the middle of the night -- that I may tell you," he said.     
"Thinking and believing do no harm to anybody," she said. "But I think you 
will do a wise thing in not closing your eyes tonight when your wife comes 
and draws a razor across your throat. But not a word about this to anyone, 
do you hear?" she said, and off she went.     
One gets to hear a good deal before one has done with this world -- but 
did one ever hear the like of this? Could it be possible? The man felt as 
strange in his head as if he had rolled down the church steeple. But 
whatever it was that ailed him, there he stood pondering and brooding.   
  
Pshaw! She was after all only a wicked woman who wanted to set them 
against each other. Yes, that was it; and he was very sorry he had not 
given her a good thrashing for her trouble.     
But although he worked away and toiled his best with his osiers, he could 
not get out of his head what Katie Grey had put into it. And when he came 
home in the evening he was so depressed and silent that his wife had never 
seen him in such a state before, so strange was he.     
"Goodness knows, what can be the matter with my husband?" she thought; and 
then she suddenly recollected what Katie Grey had told her.     
"I may as well take three hairs from his beard," she thought, "for when 
you have had a happy home for six and thirty years, it isn't likely you'll 
let it slip through your fingers all at once."     
But she did not dare to speak to her husband; she only asked him to lend 
her his razor.     
He let her have it, but he sighed and thought to himself, "I wonder if she 
would do me any harm? I wonder it she really could? Oh, no! That's quite 
impossible."     
But he put his axe close to his bed, and then they both lay down to rest.   
  
Later on in the night she asked, "Are you asleep, husband?"     
This startled the man, but he did not say a word, and the wife stole out 
of bed and lighted a candle.     
The man's heart began to beat violently.     
The wife then took the razor and drew it three times along the leather 
belt of her husband's apron, and went towards the bed.     
The blood rushed to the man's head, so that he almost lost his senses, but 
he lay as quiet as a stone, and only moved his hand towards the axe.     
The wife then came close to the bed to cut the three hairs from his beard.   
  
But as she leaned forward, the man suddenly jumped up and seized his axe, 
with which he struck his wife, who fell down dead on the floor.     
He felt he had done a very wicked deed, but he had not thought that things 
would come to this pass.     
He became much distressed -- for what was he going to do?     
It was perhaps best he followed his wife, and so he took a knife and cut 
his throat.     
Just then he heard someone laughing outside the window, and he looked in 
that direction. There he saw Katie Grey, and then he died.     
Katie Grey was now quite proud that she had been able to do more than the 
Evil One himself.     
Old Nick was not far off either. He came with a petticoat and a jacket 
hanging on a long, long pole, which he held out towards her.     
"Come nearer, so that I may shake hands with you and thank you," she said.   
  
"No, keep away from me!" he cried, and kept her back with his pole, which 
he poked at her.     
"You call me the Wicked One and the Evil One and such things, but I am not 
as wicked as you are, at any rate. Look here," he said; "take what belongs 
to you, so that I can have done with you."     
And with this he threw the pole and the clothes at her, and took to his 
heels as fast as ever he could, so afraid was he of her.     
Katie Grey stood wondering and staring after him. Just then two white 
pigeons came flying out of the cottage, and flew right up into the clouds 
above. They were the man and his wife; for though Old Nick had wished them 
evil, the Lord would take care of them.     
But what would become of Katie Grey, seeing that the Evil One himself did 
not dare to go near her? It is not easy to say.
