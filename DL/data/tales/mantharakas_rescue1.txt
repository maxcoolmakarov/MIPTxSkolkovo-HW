There were once four friends, a deer named Citr√¢nga (having a
spotted body), a crow named Laghupatanaka (flying fast), a turtle named
Mantharaka (moving slow), and a mouse named Hiranyaka (golden colored).
One day a hunter captured the turtle, tied him to his bow with strands of
grass, then set off toward home carrying his evening meal over his
shoulder. 
 Learning of their companion's capture, the three remaining friends
quickly devised a scheme to set him free. The deer ran ahead of the hunter
and laid himself in the path, pretending to be dead. The crow made the
feigned death appear even more real by pecking lightly at the deer's head.
The mouse hid himself beside the pathway and readied himself to gnaw away
his captured friend's bonds. 
 The scheme worked as planned. The hunter, bearing the captured turtle,
saw the deer, apparently dead by the side of the pathway. Setting down his
burden to free his hands, he advanced toward his unexpected find. As the
hunter neared his prey, not only did the crow fly away, but the deer
itself suddenly jumped up and bounded into the forest. Cursing his bad
luck, the hunter retraced his steps to reclaim the captive turtle, but he
found only the gnawed-off bonds. Mantharaka had disappeared into a nearby
swamp. 
 And thus were the four forest friends reunited.
