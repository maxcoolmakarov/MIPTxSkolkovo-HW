The Hodja had eight donkeys; he mounted one of them. At the end of his ride he counted them, but he saw only seven. He forgot the one he was sitting on. After dismounting he counted eight. This so confused him that he asked a passerby, "Earlier there were only seven, but now there are suddenly eight!"
  
"The one you were sitting on brought the number to eight." 
 
The Hodja answered, "But how was I to see what I had on my behind?"
