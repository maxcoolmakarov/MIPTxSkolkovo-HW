The Countess Godiva, who was a great lover of God's mother, longing to 
free the town of Coventry from the oppression of 

a heavy toll, often with urgent prayers besought her husband that, from 
regard to Jesus Christ and his mother, he would free the 

town from that service and from all other heavy burdens; and when the Earl 
sharply rebuked her for foolishly asking what was so 

much to his damage, and always forbade her evermore to speak to him on the 
subject; and while she, on the other hand, with a 

woman's pertinacity, never ceased to exasperate her husband on that 
matter, he at last made her this answer: "Mount your horse 

and ride naked, before all the people, through the market of this town 
from one end to the other, and on your return you shall 

have your request."  
 On which Godiva replied, "But will you give me permission if I am 
willing to do it?"  
 "I will," said he.  
 Whereupon the Countess, beloved of God, loosed her hair and let down 
her tresses, which covered the whole of her body 

like a veil, and then, mounting her horse and attended by two knights, she 
rode through the marketplace without being seen, 

except her fair legs, and having completed the journey, she returned with 
gladness to her astonished husband and obtained of 

him what she had asked, for Earl Leofric freed the town of Coventry and 
its inhabitants from the aforesaid service, and 

confirmed what he had done by a charter.
