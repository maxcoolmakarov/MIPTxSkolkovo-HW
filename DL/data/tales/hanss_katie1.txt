Hans's Katie was lazy and didn't want to do anything. She said to herself, "What should I do? Should I eat? Or should I sleep? Or should I work? -- Oh! I'll eat first!"  
After she had eaten her fill, she said once again, "What should I do? Should I work, or should I sleep? -- Oh! I want to get some sleep first."  
Then she lay down and slept, and when she woke up it was night, and she couldn't go out to work.  
One day Hans came home in the afternoon and once again found Katie lying in the room asleep, so he took his knife and cut off her skirt, up to her knees.  
Katie woke up and thought, "Now it's time to go out to work."  
But upon going out she saw how short her skirt was. This frightened her, and she was confused as to whether or not she was really Katie.  
She asked herself, "Am I me or am I not me?"  
Not knowing the answer, she just stood there in doubt. Finally she thought, "I'll just go home and ask if it's me.  They'll surely know."  
So she went back home, knocked on the window, and called in, "Is Hans's Katie at home?"  
The others answered, "Yes, she's lying in the room and is asleep."  
"Well then I'm not me," said Katie, now convinced.  
She walked out to the village and never came back. Thus Hans got rid of his Katie.
