Once Count Anton GÃ¼nther was hunting, when in the fury of the chase he rode ahead of his party, arriving at Mount Osenberg, not far from Oldenburg Castle. The fast ride had made him thirsty, and it so happened that as he approached Mount Osenberg it opened up, and a maiden stepped out. She offered him a drink from a magnificent horn. Taking hold of the horn with his right hand, with his left hand the count quickly swung himself back into his saddle. He threw out the drink backwards over his head, then hurriedly rode away.   
In the distance he heard the maiding wailing. Looking back he saw the mountain open up again and the maiden disappear inside. On the place where the spilled drink had touched his horse all the hairs had been singed away.   
He took the horn with him, keeping it a long time at Oldenburg Castle as an eternal reminder of the miraculous event. Later it was removed to the Hannover Art Treasury. Especially miraculous is the fact that when the cup's point was broken off no goldsmith or silversmith was able to repair it, for it is made of a metal unknown to humans.
