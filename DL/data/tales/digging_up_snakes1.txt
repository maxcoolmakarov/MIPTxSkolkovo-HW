A man in Gedernheim dreamed several times that he should go out to his orchard and dig a hole beneath the third cherry tree to the left. There he would find a pot full of money.  At first he did nothing about the dream, but when it repeated itself night after night, he finally went out and began to dig at the place described in the dream. Before long he struck something hard, and when he pulled it out it was indeed a little pot. He broke it open and saw that it was full of snakes. He became angry and threw them into the brook.  
One of them fell to the ground, and he inadvertantly loaded it onto his hand cart with a bundle of twigs, which he hauled home.  When he unloaded the cart a roll of money fell out with the twigs. He opened it, and silver thalers rolled out onto the ground. He quickly ran back to the brook and spent the rest of the day looking for the other snakes, but he could not find them.  
He kept the silver thalers a long time, and no one recognized the pattern that they were stamped with.
