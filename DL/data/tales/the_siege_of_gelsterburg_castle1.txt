Gelsterburg Castle once stood on a steep hill not far from the village of Trubenhausen above the Gelster River, which flows into the Werra River near Witzenhausen. Now only its moat and embankment remain. Once this castle was besieged, and neither weapons nor blockade could defeat it.   
A secret passageway led from the castle to the outside, and the lord of the castle rode out through it whenever he wanted to, but always taking care to reverse the horseshoes on his horse. Nonetheless, the passageway was finally discovered, and now the besieged occupants were faced with starvation or surrender. Then the knight's beautiful wife dared to present herself to besieging soldiers and ask them for mercy for herself. The woman's tears touched the enemy's heart, and she was granted mercy. Then she asked for permission to remove from the castle whatever she could carry in her apron. This too was granted to her.   
She rushed back into the castle and sewed for herself a large apron, in which she carried her husband to safety, thus rescuing his freedom and saving his life. To this day the boundary stone can be seen where she stopped to rest with her heavy burden.
