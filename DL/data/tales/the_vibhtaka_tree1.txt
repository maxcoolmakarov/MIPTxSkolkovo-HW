There is a large village called Kukhâddâ; in it dwelt a certain Jarasa, who was a great fool. His wife's name was Devikâ. She was a flighty, ill- conducted person, and had a lover -- a Brahman -- whom she used to meet under a Vibhîtaka tree, some way from the village. These meetings were a great subject of gossip in the place, and in course of time her husband heard of them. So he made up his mind to see into the matter himself and went and climbed into the tree.   
What he saw from his hiding-place fully justified all the gossip, and he called out to his wife: "You good-for-nothing hussy! You have been up to this game for some time past."   
She was put into somewhat of a difficulty and said: "I don't know what you mean!"   
"I will let you know what I mean," he answered, "if you will just wait till I come down."   
So she promised to wait till he came down from the tree, and meanwhile sent her lover away.   
At last her husband reached the ground. "It is of no use your making excuses," he said. "You have been caught in  flagranti delicto. "   
"My dear husband!" she replied, "You must know that this tree has very peculiar properties: anyone who climbs up into it can see at once whether their husband or wife has attractions away from home."   
Her husband replied, "Well, you climb up and see if it is so."   
Which she did, and cried out: "You good-for-nothing wretch! You have been running after other women for days and days."   
As this was perfectly true the fool had nothing to say, and so he made it up with his wife and they went home together.
