There were formerly werewolves. One could transform oneself into a
werewolf by putting on a belt. A servant understood how to do this, and
while the others were asleep at noontime he ate an entire foal. One of the
men just pretended to be asleep and observed everything. From Glane near
Iburg.
 If you throw a piece of iron or steel over a hare that is a transformed
human, or over a werewolf, then the human will immediately appear before
you completely naked. They call that "making blank" the witch, the wolf,
and so forth. The werewolf's pelt bursts crosswise at its forehead, and
the naked human emerges from this opening.
