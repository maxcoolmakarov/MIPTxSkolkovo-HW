Widely distributed proverbs express with obvious irony and apparent
acceptance the view that parents cannot necessarily expect the same care
in their age that they earlier tendered to their children: 
 
 One father can better nourish ten children than ten children can
nourish one father.  
 Parents love their children more than do children their parents.  
 The old man saves, his son is a spendthrift.  
 Good deeds are wasted on old men and on rogues.  
 Age pipes and youth dances.  
 The parents' death is often the children's good fortune.

 If the mother looks after the child, both smile. If the child looks
after the mother, both cry. (Jewish proverb, heard in Pittsburgh, June
1998)
 
 This pessimistic view is also reflected in animal fables: 
 A raven was carrying his chicks, one at a time, from an island
to the mainland. In mid flight he asked the first, "Who will carry me when
I am old and can no longer fly?" 
 "I will," answered the young raven, but the father did not
believe him, and dropped him into the sea. 
 The same question was put to the second chick. He too replied,
"I will carry you when you are old," and the father also let him fall into
the sea. 
 The last chick received the same question, but he answered,
"Father, you will have to fend for yourself when you are old, because by
then I will have my own family to care for." 
 "You speak the truth," said the father raven, and carried the
chick to safety.
