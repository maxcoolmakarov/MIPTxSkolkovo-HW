You must know that Judas was the one who betrayed Jesus Christ.  
 Now when Judas betrayed him, his Master said: "Repent, Judas, for I
pardon you." 
 But Judas, not at all! He departed with his bag of money, in despair
and cursing heaven and earth. What did he do? While he was going along
thus desperate he came across a tamarind tree. (You must know that the
tamarind was formerly a large tree, like the olive and walnut.) When he
saw this tamarind a wild thought entered his mind, remembering the treason
he had committed. He made a noose in a rope and hung himself to the
tamarind. And hence it is (because this traitor Judas was cursed by God)
that the tamarind tree dried up, and from that time on it ceased growing
up into a tree and became a short, twisted, and tangled bush; and its wood
is good for nothing, neither to burn, nor to make anything out of, and all
on account of Judas, who hanged himself on it. 
 Some say that the soul of Judas went to the lowest hell, to suffer the
most painful torments; but I have heard, from older persons who can know,
that Judas's soul has a severer sentence. They say that it is in the air,
always wandering about the world, without being able to rise higher or
fall lower; and every day, on all the tamarind shrubs that it meets, it
sees its body hanging and torn by the dogs and birds of prey. They say
that the pain he suffers cannot be told, and that it makes the flesh creep
to think of it. And thus Jesus Christ condemned him for his great
treason.
