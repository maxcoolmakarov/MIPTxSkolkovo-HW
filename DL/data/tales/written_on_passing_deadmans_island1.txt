In the Gulf of St Lawrence, Late in the Evening, Sept. 1804.  
 
 
See you, beneath yon cloud so dark,  
Fast gliding along, a gloomy bark?  
Her sails are full, though the wind is still,  
And there blows not a breath her sails to fill!  

Oh! what doth that vessel of darkness bear?  
The silent calm of the grave is there,  
Save now and again a death-knell rung,  
And the flap of the sails, with night-fog hung!  

There lieth a wreck on the dismal shore  
Of cold and pitiless Labrador;  
Where, under the moon, upon mounts of frost,  
Full many a mariner's bones are tost!  

Yon shadowy bark hath been to that wreck,  
And the dim blue fire, that lights her deck,  
Doth play on as pale and livid a crew,  
As ever yet drank the church-yard dew! 
 
To Dead-Man's Isle, in the eye of the blast,  
To Dead-Man's Isle, she speeds her fast;  
By skeleton shapes her sails are furl'd,  
And the hand that steers is not of this world! 
 
Oh! hurry thee on -- oh! hurry thee on,  
Thou terrible bark! ere the night be gone,  
Nor let morning look on so foul a sight  
As would blanch for ever her rosy light!
