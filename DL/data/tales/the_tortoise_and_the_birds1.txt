A tortoise desired to change its place of residence, so he asked an
eagle to carry him to his new home, promising her a rich reward for her
trouble. The eagle agreed, and seizing the tortoise by the shell with her
talons, soared aloft. On their way they met a crow, who said to the eagle,
"Tortoise is good eating." 
 "The shell is too hard," said the eagle in reply. 
 "The rocks will soon crack the shell," was the crow's answer; and the
eagle, let fall the tortoise on a sharp rock, and the two birds made a
hearty meal off the tortoise. 
 Never soar aloft on an enemy's pinions.
