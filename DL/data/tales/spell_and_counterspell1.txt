Once there was a wealthy peasant who died without children, leaving all his possessions to his wife. One evening an old stranger came to her house and asked for shelter for the night, even if he had to sleep in the hayloft.   
At first the woman did not want to take him in, but finally she agreed to do so, when the old man said, "Madame, I am a poor and unassuming man, but you cannot know how I can help you if you allow me to stay here."  
During the night when everyone in the house was asleep, the old man was still lying awake in the loft when he heard footsteps in the entryway. Thinking that this was suspicious, he krept from his bed in the hay and saw below him three pitch-black fellows with unusual candles in their hands moving about the main room.  The old man immediately knew what was happening. The black companions were intent on robbery. Their candles were the toes of unborn children, and as long as they were burning everyone would remain in the deepest sleep -- a spell which the robbers themselves as well as our old man were protected against through a counter-spell.   
While the black fellows were busy emptying trunks and chests the old man quietly climbed down the ladder, found the thieves and murmured a charm that held them all fast. Then he extinguished their candles and woke the woman and the servants. They came with lights.   
"Madame," said the old man, "have these fellows washed up so we can see their actual faces."   
This was done, and the widow did not believe her eyes when the layer of soot was removed, revealing her brothers-in-law.   
"My good man," she said to the old man, "you captured these, my dear relatives, and you will be able to release them as well. Please do so! They will thank you and do us no more harm."  
The old man released them with a charm, and the widow told her brothers-in-law to be on their way. Deeply shamed, they crept away.
