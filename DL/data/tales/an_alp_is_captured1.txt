A cabinetmaker in BÃ¼hl slept in a bed in his workshop. Several
nights in a row something laid itself onto his chest and pressed against
him until he could hardly breathe. After talking the matter over with a
friend, the next night he lay awake in bed. At the stroke of twelve a cat
slipped in through a hole. The cabinetmaker quickly stopped up the hole,
caught the cat, and nailed down one of its paws. Then he went to
sleep. 
 The next morning he found a beautiful naked woman in the cat's place.
One of her hands was nailed down. She pleased him so much that he married
her. 
 One day, after she had borne him three children, she was with him in
his workshop, when he said to her, "Look, that is where you came in!" and
he opened the hole that had been stopped up until now. 
 The woman suddenly turned into a cat, ran out through the opening, and
she was never seen again.
