It is little more than half a century since the good people of Whittinghame got happily quit of a ghost, which, in the shape of an "unchristened wean," had annoyed them for many years. An unnatural mother having murdered her child at a large tree, not far from the village, the ghost of the deceased was afterwards seen, on dark nights, running in a distracted manner between the said tree and the church-yard, and was occasionally heard to greet.   
It was understood by the villagers, that it was obliged thus to take the air, and bewail itself, on account of wanting a name -- no anonymous person, it seems, being able to get a proper footing in the other world.   
Nobody durst speak to the unhappy little spirit, out of a superstitious dread of dying immediately after; and, to all appearance, the village of Whittinghame was destined to be haunted till the end of time, for want of an exorcist. At length, however, it providentially happened, that a drunkard, one night, in reeling home, encountered it; and, being fearless in the strength of John Barleycorn, did not hesitate to address it in the same familiar style as if it had been one of his own flesh and blood fellow topers.   
"How's a' wi' ye this morning, Short-Hoggers?" cried the courageous villager,  when the ghost immediately ran away, joyfully exclaiming: 
  
Oh weel's me noo, I've gotten a name;  
They ca' me Short-Hoggers o' Whittinghame! 
  
And, since that time, it has never been either seen or heard of. The name which the drunkard applied to it denotes that the ghost wore short stockings without feet, a proabable supposition, considering the long series of years during which it had walked.   
Our informant received this story, with the rhyme, from the lips of an old woman of Whittinghame, who had seen the ghost.
