A Wolf prowling about for his Supper, pass'd by a Door where a little Child was bawling, and a Nurse chiding it.  
"Leave your Vixen-Tricks," says the Woman, "or I'll throw you to the Wolf."  
The Wolf, hearing this, waited a pretty while, in hope the Woman would be as good as her Word. But the Child being frighted into better Temper, the Tone was turned, and he had the Mortification to hear the Nurse say, "That's a good Dear! If the Wolf comes for my Child, we'll e'en beat his Brains out."  
Upon which the Wolf went muttering away as fas as he could.  
 Moral 
 An ingenuous Spirit will be wrought upon by fair Words; but a perverse one must be terrified into its Duty, if soft means will not do. 
 
 Reflection 
Terrors are as necessary to quiet froward Spirits, as Praises and Rewards are to encourage the Tractable. But yet we must apply this principally to grown Persons; for, as the Children or Infants, there cannot be a more pernicious Error than to terrify them, as is the comm Practice of foolish Nurses, with  Bugbears, Hobgoblins, Raw-heads and Bloody-bones,  &c. which often fix such Impressions of Fear and Apprehension on the  Infant , as can never be rooted out of the  Man .
