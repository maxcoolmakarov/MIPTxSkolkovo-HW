The ratcatcher knows a particular tone, which he sounds nine times on
his fife, and then all rats follow after him, wherever he wants them to
go, into a pond or a pool. 
 Once a village could not be rid of its rats, and finally they sent for
the ratcatcher. He prepared a hazel stick in such a manner that all rats
were drawn toward it. They would then have to follow anyone who took hold
of the stick. Waiting until a Sunday, he laid it in front of the church
door. As the people were going home after the worship service, a miller
came by, saw the good-looking stick lying there and said, "That will make
a fine walking stick for me." He picked it up and left the village,
walking toward his mill. 
 Meanwhile a number of rats began to leave their cracks and corners and
came running and jumping across the fields toward him. The miller, still
carrying the stick, had no idea what was happening. When he came to a
meadow, they ran from their holes and ran across the fields and pastures
after him. Running ahead, they were inside his house before he himself
was, and they stayed there as a plague that could not be overcome.
