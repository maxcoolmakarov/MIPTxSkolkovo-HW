As told in Essex about the year 1800 
There was once a little boy, and his mother sent him to buy a sheep's head and pluck; afraid he should forget it, the lad kept saying all the way along: 
  
Sheep's head and pluck!  
Sheep's head and pluck! 
  
Trudging along, he came to a stile; but in getting over he fell and hurt himself, and, beginning to blubber, forgot what he was sent for. So he stood a little while to consider; at last he thought he recollected it, and began to repeat: 
  
Liver and lights [lungs] and gall and all!    
Liver and lights and gall and all!  
  
Away he went again, and came to where a man was sick, bawling out: 
  
Liver and lights and gall and all!  
Liver and lights and gall and all!  
  
Whereon the man laid hold of him and beat him, bidding him say:  
  
Pray God send no more up!  
Pray God send no more up!  
  
The youngster strode along, uttering these words, till he reached a field where a hind [farm servant] was sowing wheat: 
  
Pray God send no more up!  
Pray God send no more up!  
  
This was all his cry. So the sower began to thrash him, and charged him to repeat: 
  
Pray God send plenty more!  
Pray God send plenty more!  
  
Off the child scampered with these words in his mouth till he reached a churchyard and met a funeral, but he went on with his: 
  
Pray God send plenty more!  
Pray God send plenty more!  
  
The chief mourner seized and punished him, and bade him repeat: 
  
Pray God send the soul to heaven!  
Pray God send the soul to heaven!  
  
Away went the boy, and met a dog and a bitch going to be hung, but his cry rang out: 
  
Pray God send the soul to heaven!  
Pray God send the soul to heaven!  
  
The good folk nearly were furious, seized and struck him, charging him to say: 
  
A dog and a bitch a-going to be hung!  
A dog and a bitch a-going to be hung!  
  
This the poor fellow did, till he overtook a man and a woman going to be married. "Oh! oh!" he shouted:  
  
A dog and a bitch a-going to be hung!  
A dog and a bitch a-going to be hung!  
  
The man was enraged, as we may well think, gave him many a thump, and ordered him to repeat: 
  
I wish you much joy!  
I wish you much joy!  
  
This he did, jogging along, till he came to two labourers who had fallen into a ditch. The lad kept bawling out:  
  
I wish you much joy!  
I wish you much joy! 
  
This vexed one of the folk so sorely that he used all his strength, scrambled out, beat the crier, and told him to say: 
  
The one is out, I wish the other was!  
The one is out, I wish the other was!  
  
On went young 'un till he found a fellow with only one eye; but he kept up his song: 
  
The one is out, I wish the other was!  
The one is out, I wish the other was!  
  
This was too much for Master One-eye, who grabbed him and chastised him, bidding him call: 
  
The one side gives good light, I wish the other did!   
The one side gives good light, I wish the other did!  
  
So he did, to be sure, till he came to a house, one side of which was on fire. The people here thought it was he who had set the place a-blazing, and straightway put him in prison. The end was, the judge put on his black cap and condemned him to die.
