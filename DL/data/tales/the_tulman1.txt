There was a woman in Baile Thangusdail, and she was out seeking a couple of calves; and the night and lateness caught her, and there came rain and tempest, and she was seeking shelter. She went to a knoll with the couple of calves, and she was striking a tether-peg into it. The knoll opened. She heard a gleegashing as if a pot-hook were clashing beside a pot. She took wonder, and she stopped striking the tether-peg.   
A woman put out her head and all above her middle, and she said, "What business hast thou to be troubling this tulman in which I make my dwelling?"   
"I am taking care of this couple of calves, and I am but weak. Where shall I go with them?"   
"Thou shalt go with them to that breast down yonder. Thou wilt see a tuft of grass. If thy couple of calves eat that tuft of grass, thou wilt not be a day without a milk cow as long as thou art alive, because thou hast taken my counsel."  
As she said, she never was without a milk cow after that, and she was alive fourscore and fifteen years after the night that was there.
