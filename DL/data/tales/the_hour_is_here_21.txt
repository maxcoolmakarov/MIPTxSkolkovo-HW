In the vicinity of Rothenburg some people were in a field busy with the 
harvest when they heard a voice calling loudly and clearly from a nearby 
pond, "The hour is here, but the man is not yet here." That same moment 
they saw a rider galloping toward them. Although they waved and shouted 
that he should keep his distance, he directed his horse toward the pond, 
jumping directly into the water. His horse soon emerged, but the rider had 
disappeared and was never seen again.
