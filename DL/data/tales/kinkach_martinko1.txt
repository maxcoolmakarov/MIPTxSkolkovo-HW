Once upon a time there was a poor woman who had an only daughter, named
Helen, a
very lazy girl.  One day when she had refused to do a single thing, her
mother
took her down to the banks of a stream and began to strike her fingers
with a
flat stone, just as you do in beating linen to wash it.  
The girl cried a good deal.  A prince, Lord of the Red Castle, happened at
that
moment to pass by, and inquired as to the cause of such treatment, for it
horrified him that a mother should so ill-use her child.  
"Why should I not punish her?" answered the woman.  "The idle girl can do
nothing but spin hemp into gold thread."  
"Really?" cried he.  "Does she really know how to spin gold thread out of
hemp? 
If that be so, sell her to me."  
"Willingly; how much will you give me for her?"  
"Half a measure of gold."  
"Take her," said the mother; and she gave him her daughter as soon as the
money
was paid.  
The prince placed the girl behind him on the saddle, put spurs to his
horse, and
took her home.  
On reaching the Red Castle, the prince led Helen into a room filled from
floor
to ceiling with hemp, and having supplied her with distaff and spinning
wheel,
said, "When you have spun all this hemp into gold thread I will make you
my
wife."  
Then he went out, locking the door after him.  
On finding herself a prisoner, the poor girl wept as if her heart would
break. 
Suddenly she saw a very odd looking little man seated on the window sill.
He
wore a red cap, and his boots were made of some strange sort of material.
 
"Why do you weep so?" he asked.  
"I cannot help it," she replied, "I am but a miserable slave.  I have been
ordered to spin all this hemp into gold thread, but it is impossible, I
can
never do it, and I know not what will become of me."  
I will do it for you in three days, on condition that at the end of that
time
you guess my right name, and tell me what the boots I am wearing now are
made
of."  
Without for one moment reflecting as to whether she would be able to guess
aright she consented.  The uncanny little man burst out laughing, and
taking her
distaff set to work at once.  
All day as the distaff moved the hemp grew visibly less, while the skein
of gold
thread became larger and larger.  
The little man spun all the time, and, without stopping an instant,
explained to
Helen how to make thread of pure gold.  As night drew on he tied up the
skein,
saying to the girl, "Well, do you know my name yet?  Can you tell me what
my
boots are made of?"  
Helen replied that she could not, upon which he grinned and disappeared
through
the window.  She then sat and looked at the sky, and thought, and thought,
and
thought, and lost herself in conjecturing as to what the little man's name
might
be, and in trying to guess what was the stuff his boots were made of.
Were they
of leather? or perhaps plaited rushes? or straw? or cast iron?  No, they
did not
look like anything of that sort.  And as to his name -- that was a still
more
difficult problem to solve.  
"What shall I call him?" said she to herself -- "John?  Or Henry?  Who
knows?
perhaps it is Paul or Joseph."  
These thoughts so filled her mind that she forgot to eat her dinner.  Her
meditations were interrupted by cries and groans from outside, where she
saw an
old man with white hair sitting under the castle wall.  
"Miserable old man that I am," cried he; "I die of hunger and thirst, but
no one
pities my sufferings."
Helen hastened to give him her dinner, and told him to come next day,
which he
promised to do.  
After again thinking for some time what answers she should give the little
old
man, she fell asleep on the hemp.  
The little old man did not fail to make his appearance the first thing
next
morning, and remained all day spinning the gold thread.  The work
progressed 
before their eyes, and it was only when evening came that he repeated his
questions.  Not receiving a satisfactory answer, he vanished in a fit of
mocking
laughter.  Helen sat down by the window to think; but think as she might,
no
answer to these puzzling questions occurred to her.  
While thus wondering the hungry old man again came by, and she gave him
her
dinner.  She was heart-sick and her eyes were full of tears, for she
thought she
would never guess the spinner's name, nor of what stuff his boots were
made,
unless perhaps God would help her.  
"Why are you so sad?" asked the old man when he had eaten and drunk; "tell
me
the cause of you grief, dear lady."  
For a long time she would not tell him, thinking it would be useless; but
at
last, yielding to his entreaties, she gave a full account of the
conditions
under which the gold thread was made, explaining that unless she could
answer
the little old man's questions satisfactorily she feared some great
misfortune
would befall her.    
The old man listened attentively, then, nodding his head, he said: "In
coming
through the forest today I passed close to a large pile of burning wood,
round
which were placed nine iron pots.  A little man in a red cap was running
round
and jumping over them, singing these words:  
 
My sweet friend, fair Helen, at the Red Castle near,  
Two days and two nights seeks my name to divine,  
She'll never find out, so the third night 'tis clear  
My sweet friend, fair Helen, can't fail to be mine.  
Hurrah! for my name is Kinkach Martinko,  
Hurrah! for my boots are of doggies' skin O!  
"Now that is exactly what you want to know, my dear girl; so do not
forget, and
you are saved."  
And with these words the old man vanished.  
Helen was greatly astonished, but she took care to fix in her memory all
that
the good fellow had told her, and then went to sleep, feeling that she
could
face tomorrow without fear.  
One the third day, very early in the morning, the little old man appeared
and
set busily to work, for he knew that all the hemp must be spun before
sunset,
and that then he should be able to claim his rights.  When evening came
all the
hemp was gone, and the room shone with the brightness of the golden
thread.  
As soon as his work was done, the queer little old man with the red cap
drew
himself up with a great deal of assurance, and with his hand in his
pockets
strutted up and down before Helen, ordering her to tell him his right name
and
to say of what stuff the boots were made; but he felt certain that she
would not
be able to answer aright.  
"Your name is Kinkach Martinko, and your boots are made of dogskin," she
replied
without the slightest hesitation.  
At these words he spun round on the floor like a bobbin, tore out his hair
and
beat his breast with rage, roaring so that the very walls trembled.  
"It is lucky for you that you have guessed.  If you had not, I should have
torn
you to pieces on this very spot:" so saying he rushed out of the window
like a
whirlwind.  
Helen felt deeply grateful towards the old man who had told her the
answers, and
hoped to be able to thank him in person.  But he never appeared again.  
The Prince of the Red Castle was very pleased with her for having
accomplished
her task so punctually and perfectly, and he married her as he had
promised.  
Helen was truly thankful to have escaped the dangers that had threatened
her,
and her happiness as a princess was greater than she had dared hope.  She
had,
too, such a good stock of gold thread that she never had occasion to spin
any
more all her life long.
