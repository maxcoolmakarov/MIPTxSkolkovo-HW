Old Boreas and the sun, one day   
Espied a traveller on his way,  
Whose dress did happily provide  
Against whatever might betide.  
The time was autumn, when, indeed,   
All prudent travellers take heed.  
The rains that then the sunshine dash,  
And Iris with her splendid sash,  
Warn one who does not like to soak  
To wear abroad a good thick cloak.  
Our man was therefore well bedight  
With double mantle, strong and tight.  

"This fellow," said the wind, "has meant   
To guard from every ill event;  
But little does he wot that I  
Can blow him such a blast  
That, not a button fast,  
His cloak shall cleave the sky.  
Come, here's a pleasant game, Sir Sun!   
Wilt play?"   

Said Ph≈ìbus, "Done!  
  We'll bet between us here  
  Which first will take the gear  
  From off this cavalier.  
  Begin, and shut away  
  The brightness of my ray."  

"Enough." Our blower, on the bet,  
  Swell'd out his pursy form  
  With all the stuff for storm --  
The thunder, hail, and drenching wet,   
And all the fury he could muster;  
Then, with a very demon's bluster,  
He whistled, whirl'd, and splash'd,  
And down the torrents dash'd,  
  Full many a roof uptearing  
  He never did before,  
Full many a vessel bearing  
     To wreck upon the shore, --  
   And all to doff a single cloak.  
    But vain the furious stroke;  
      The traveller was stout,  
     And kept the tempest out,  
       Defied the hurricane,  
       Defied the pelting rain ;  
  And as the fiercer roar'd the blast,   
  His cloak the tighter held he fast.  

 The sun broke out, to win the bet;  
 He caused the clouds to disappear,  
 Befresh'd and warm'd the cavalier,  
  And through his mantle made him sweat,  
 Till off it came, of course,  
 In less than half an hour;  
 And yet the sun saved half his power. --   
So much doth mildness more than force.
