The following variant of a well-known folktale was obtained from the Rev. 
T. H. Philpott, of Hedge End, Botley, who learned it from his mother in 
Worcestershire:  
  
A hedgehog made a wager with the devil to run him a race, the hedgehog to 
have the choice of time and place. He chose to run up and down a ditch at 
night. When the time came the hedgehog rolled himself up at one end of the 
ditch, and got a friend to roll himself up at the other; then he started 
the devil off. At the other end of the ditch, the friend said to the 
devil, "Now we go off again." Each hedgehog kept repeating this formula at 
his own end of the ditch, while the devil ran up and down between them, 
until they ran him to death.  
 
This story would be introduced by the remark, "Now we go off again, as the 
hedgehog said to the devil."
