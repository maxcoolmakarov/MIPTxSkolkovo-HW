There was once a sudden flood in the Indus, which washed away numbers of people, and, among others, the wife of a certain Baneyrwal.  The distracted husband was wandering along the banks of the river, looking for the dead body, when a countryman accosted him thus, "Oh friend, if, as I am informed, your wife has been carried away in the flood, she must have gone down the stream with the rest of the poor creatures; yet you are going up the stream."  
"Ah, sir," answered the wretched Baneyrwal, "you did not know that wife of mine.  She always took an opposite course to everyone else.  And even now that she is drowned, I know full well that, if other bodies have floated down the river, hers  must  have floated up."
