In a certain place there once lived an old merchant by the name of Kâmâtura, which means "lovesick."  His wife having died, he fell deeply in love with the daughter of a poor merchant, gave a large sum of money for her, and married her.    
She, however, was overcome by sorrow, and did not even want to look at the old man.  For is it not right, that:   The white field of hair on an old man's head attracts the greatest contempt.  To avoid it, a girl will take the widest detour, like someone crossing a graveyard strewn with bones.  And further:  The body is bent.  The gait is broken.  Teeth are lost.  Vision is weak.  Beauty is destroyed.  The mouth is always filled with spit.  Relatives do not follow his advice.  His wife does not obey him.  Alas!  Alas!  Even the son despises a man struck down by age!   
One night they were lying in bed together, her face turned away from him, when a thief broke into their house.  When she saw the thief, she was overcome by fear, and, in spite of his age, she clasped her husband tightly in her arms.  The surprise embrace caused every hair on his body to stand on end.    
He said to himself, "Why is she holding me?"    
Then looking around, he too discovered the thief crouched in the corner, and he realized, "She is embracing me, because she is afraid of him," and said aloud, "The woman who has always despised me is embracing me tightly tonight.  Praise be to you, you granter of desire!  Take whatever of mine that you want!"  
The thief answered, "I see nothing here that I would want to take.  If in the future there is something worth taking, then I will return, but only when she is not embracing you so."
