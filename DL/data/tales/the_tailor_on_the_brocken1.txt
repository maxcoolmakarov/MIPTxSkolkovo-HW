A tailor heard that during the night between the last of April and the 
first of May witches gather on Glocker Mountain and there perform 
incredible dances. Being curious, on the preceding day he set forth and 
climbed Glocker Mountain. He hid himself among the branches of a willow 
tree and then saw how many hundred witches flew there through the air, had 
a lovely feast, and then danced joyfully.   
One of the witches noticed him and shouted to another one, "See what a 
large burl that willow branch has. I'm going to drive my ax into it, so I 
can find it again next year." And she drove her ax into his back.   
He only felt a single stab, but from that moment onward his back was very 
heavy, and when the sun came up he saw with terror from his shadow that he 
was now a hunchback.   
Nevertheless, the following year when the first of May was approaching he 
could not restrain his desire to return to Glocker Mountain, because the 
dances had pleased him so much. Seated once again in the willow tree, the 
witch saw him, as before, and said, "I want to pull my ax out of the 
willow burl, so I won't lose it."    
She reached for his back, and he felt a light stab. From that time onward 
his hump was gone. When the witch pulled her hand back, she was holding an 
ax.
