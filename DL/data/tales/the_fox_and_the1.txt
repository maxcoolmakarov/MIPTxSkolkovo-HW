Fleas 
 
 The fox is much troubled by fleas, and this is the way in which he gets
rid of them. He hunts about until he finds a lock of wool, and then he
takes it to the river, and holds it in his mouth, and so puts the end of
his brush into the water, and down he goes slowly. The fleas run away from
the water, and at last they all run over the fox's nose into the wool, and
then the fox dips his nose under and lets the wool go off with the
stream.
