Once upon a time there was a child who was willful and did not do what his
mother wanted. For this reason God was displeased with him and caused him
to become ill,
and no doctor could help him, and in a short time he lay on his
deathbed. 
He was lowered into a grave and covered with earth, but his little arm
suddenly came
forth and reached up, and it didn't help when they put it back in and put
fresh
earth over it, for the little arm always came out again. So the mother
herself
had to go to the grave and beat the little arm with a switch, and as soon
as she
had done that, it withdrew, and the child finally came to rest beneath the
earth.
