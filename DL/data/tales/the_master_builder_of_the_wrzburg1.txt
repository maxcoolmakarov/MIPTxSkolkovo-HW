Cathedral 
 
Like so many other master builders , the master builder of the
WÃ¼rzburg Cathedral completed his temple contruction with the help of
the devil. 
 In order to eternalize himself, and in an act of proud arrogance, he
sculpted himself and his wife in bed on the ceiling of the right aisle of
the cathedral. After completing this work he sprained his foot while
climbing down. He cursed his sculpture, and for this reason the devil
carried him away. 
 The depiction the the master builder next to his wife in their marriage
bed is still there, but it can be seen only on Sundays and holidays at
half past ten in the morning when the sun illuminates the picture in the
corner.
