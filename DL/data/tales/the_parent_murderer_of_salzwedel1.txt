More than two hundred years ago, it was on April 15, 1614, that a
horrible murder was committed in the old part of Salzwedel just off the
street leading to Saint Ann's Convent, that formerly stood there.  
 A merchant's servant by the name of Dietrich Schulze stabbed his father
and his mother to death.  He stabbed the father four times, and when the
mother came to the father's aid, he stabbed her three times. 
 He was sentenced to die, and the sentence was carried out on the fourth
of May of the same year.  First his right hand, with which he had
committed the horrible deed, was cut off.  Then he was tortured three
times with red-hot pincers, first in the marketplace, second in front of
the house where the murder was committed, and finally in the tower
itself. 
 Then he was dragged to the place of execution and placed on the wheel
upside down, half sitting and half lying.  It was miraculous and horrible
to see how the hand with which he had committed this terrible deed
continued to bleed for three days on the wheel.
