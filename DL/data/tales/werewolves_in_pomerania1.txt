The belief in werewolves is common throughout all of Pomerania. One can
transform oneself into a werewolf by girding oneself with a strap that has
been cut from the back of a man who has been hanged.  Werewolves are
especially fond of attacking horses. In the village of Bork not far from
Stargard for a long time a man made his entire living by walking around
the horse pasture in the village every night and whispering mysterious
words by which he protected the horses against werewolves and other
wolves, and this in spite of the fact that wolves had long not been seen
in that region.
