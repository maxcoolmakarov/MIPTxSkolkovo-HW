A young man made the following contract with the devil: The devil was
to provide the man with money. In return, at a predetermined time the man
was to give the devil work that would keep him busy an entire day. If the
man were able to do this, then the devil would have given him the money
for nothing. If he were not able to do this, then the man would belong to
the devil, and the latter would be able to take him away.
 It came to pass that the time lapsed just as the man was celebrating
his wedding. A boy came up to him and told him that a strange gentleman
was outside who wanted to speak with him. The man immediately remembered
the devil and did not go. The boy returned and called for him again, but
still he did not go.
 Then the devil came inside personally and demanded either a task or the
man himself. The man showed him a field of clover and told him to mow it.
This would have taken a single man several days, but the devil finished it
in an instant and demanded another task. Then the man took a bushel of
clover seeds, scattered them over the field, and told the devil to gather
them back up. It was a simple matter for him, and he was finished in a
half hour. The man became terrified when the devil asked for yet another
task.
 Then the man's bride noticed her husband's concern and said, "What is
the matter? Why do you keep running in and out?"
 The man confessed everything to her and told her of the danger that he
now faced.
 The bride said, "I will help you. You should have told me about it
earlier!" Plucking out one of her short curly hairs, she gave it to her
husband and said, "Take this to the devil and demand that he straighten
it!"
 The man did this. The devil made an ugly face, then picked and pulled
and bent away at the hair. He even placed it on an anvil and tried to
pound it straight with a hammer, but it was all for nothing. The devil was
not able to complete this task that day. The hair remained curly and
crooked, and he was tricked out of his prize.
