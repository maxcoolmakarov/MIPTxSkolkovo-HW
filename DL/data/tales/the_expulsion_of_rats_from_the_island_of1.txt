Ummanz 
 
Many years ago there were so many rats on the Island of Ummanz that the
inhabitants could not find refuge from the vermin.  Then a sorcerer from
abroad presented himself, offering -- for a large sum of money -- to drive
all the rats from the island.  The people of Ummanz agreed to pay this
very high price, even though he stated from the beginning that he would be
able to ban the rats only for the lifetime of the population that
currently lived there.  Then the sorcerer drove all the rats to the
southwestern point of Ummanz and into the water.  This region is thus
called the  Rott  even today. 
 They say that the soil from this area formerly could be used as
protection against rats.  People who were plagued with rats would go to
Ummanz and get a sack of soil from the  Rott . A small handful of
this soil shook into the rat holes would be sufficient to drive the rats
away within a few hours.  All this was credited to the foreign
sorcerer. 
 More recently, however, following the death of the earlier population
and after many outsiders had come to Ummanz, rats found their way back to
the island, and since then not even soil from the  Rott  will help to
drive them away.
