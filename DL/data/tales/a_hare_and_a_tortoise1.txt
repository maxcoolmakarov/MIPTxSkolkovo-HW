What a dull heavy Creature (says a  Hare ) is this same  Tortoise! 
  And yet (says the  Tortoise ) I'll run with you for a Wager. 
'Twas 
 done and done , and the  Fox , by Consent, was to be the Judge. 
They started together, and the  Tortoise  kept jogging on still till 
he came to the End of the Course. The  Hare  laid himself down about 
Midway, and took a Nap; for, says he, I can fetch up the tortoise when I 
please: But he over-slept himself, it seems, for when he came to wake, 
though he scudded away as fast as 'twas possible, the  Tortoise  got 
to the Post before him, and won the Wager.  
 
The Moral  
 
Up and be doing,  is an edifying Text; for Action is the Business of 
Life, and there's no Thought of ever coming to the end of our Journey in 
time, if we sleep by the way.    
 
REFLECTION
 
  
UNNECESSARY Delays in all pressing Affairs are but just so much time lost, 
beside the hazard of intervening Contingencies that may endanger a total 
Disappointment. Let not the Work of  to Day  be put off till  to 
Morrow:   For the future is uncertain; and he that lies down to sleep 
in the middle of Business that requires Action, does not know whether he 
shall live to wake again: Or with the  Hare  in the Fable here, 
out-sleep his Opportunity. a plodding Diligence brings us sooner to our 
Journey's End, than a fluttering Way of advancing by Starts and by Stops; 
for 'tis Perseverance alone that can carry us thorough-stitch.
