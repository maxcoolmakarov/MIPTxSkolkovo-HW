A widow weeping on her husband's grave was approached by an engaging gentleman who, in a respectful manner, assured her that he had long entertained for her the most tender feelings.
  
"Wretch!" cried the widow. "Leave me this instant! Is this a time to talk to me of love?"
 
"I assure you, madam, that I had not intended to disclose my affection," the engaging gentleman humbly explained," but the power of your beauty has overcome my discretion."
 
"You should see me when I have not been crying," said the widow.
