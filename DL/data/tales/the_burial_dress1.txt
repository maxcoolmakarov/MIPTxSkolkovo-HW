As was previously the custom, a woman made her own burial dress while 
she was still living. After she died, her daughter-in-law thought that a 
lesser dress would do just as well. Therefore she kept the burial dress 
for herself and dressed the dead woman in an old worn-out one. However, 
the old woman had scarcely been buried when in the evening a voice was 
heard in the parlor saying, "I want to have my dress." This happened every 
evening, and did not stop until the right dress was laid on the grave.
