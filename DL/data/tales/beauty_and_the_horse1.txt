There was once a merchant whose business was so immense that he was the 
wealthiest tradesman known. He had three daughters, one of whom was named 
Beauty. One day the merchant received word from friends far away, 
informing him of the failure of one of his connections, and he at once 
prepared himself for a journey to that place. The two older daughters 
asked him to buy all sorts of finery and dresses for them, but Beauty 
asked for nothing at all. When the merchant left, these two girls had 
rubbed their eyes with onions in order to look as if they were sorry to 
bid him good-bye; but Beauty needed no such artifice; her tears were quite 
natural.   
So the merchant went away, and in due time arrived at the place where the 
tradesman of whom he had heard the bad news was living. But instead of 
obtaining money, as he hoped, he was kicked and beaten so violently that 
it seems a great wonder he came away without losing his life. Of course he 
had now nothing to do but return, so he mounted his horse and turned 
homeward. Towards evening he unfortunately lost his way, and when it 
became quite dark he knew no better than to ride in the direction of a 
light which was shining from a distance. At length he reached a beautiful 
little palace, but although it was lighted, there seemed to be no one at 
home.   
After a while he found a shelter and food for his horse -- pure oats, and 
nothing else. The animal might well dance for joy, for both man and beast 
were well-nigh exhausted from the long ride. When the horse had been 
provided for, the master stepped into the palace. There a light was 
burning, and a table was laid for one person, but no one was to be seen. 
As the merchant was tired, he sat down without invitation, and ate a 
hearty supper. A fine bed was there, too, and when he had eaten enough he 
stretched himself among the pillows and enjoyed a good night's rest.   
The next morning everything appeared as on the evening before. The horse 
was well supplied, and as breakfast was ready on the table, the merchant 
seated himself, doing justice to the good meal. At he was now ready to 
leave, he thought it might be well to look over the premises, and glancing 
into the garden he perceived some exquisite flowers. He went down, 
intending to carry some of them home with him as a present for Beauty; but 
no sooner had he touched them than a horse came running towards him as 
fast as it could trot, saying, "You thoughtless man; I was good to you 
last night, I gave you shelter and provisions, and now you would even take 
with you the most beautiful flowers in my garden."   
The merchant immediately begged pardon, saying that he had intended the 
flowers as a gift for Beauty, his daughter.   
"Have you several daughters?" asked the horse.   
"Yes, I have three, and Beauty is the youngest one," he replied.   
"Now you must promise me," said the horse, "that you will give me the 
daughter whose name is Beauty; if you refuse, I will take your life."   
Well, the merchant did not wish to lose his life, so he promised to bring 
his daughter to the palace, whereupon the horse disappeared among the 
trees, and the man rode home.   
As soon as he reached his house, the two older daughters came out and 
asked him for the fine things which they were expecting. But Beauty came 
and bid him welcome. He produced the flowers and gave them to her, saying, 
"These are for you, but they cost your life," and he then told her how he 
had been obliged to make the fatal promise to the horse, in order to save 
his life.   
Beauty at once said, "I am willing to follow you, father, and am always 
glad to help you." They started on their journey, and soon arrived at the 
palace.   
As before, no one was to be seen, but the merchant found food for his 
horses and a good stable The table was also laid for two persons, and 
there were two beds. Having done justice to the supper, father and 
daughter retired and slept soundly. When they awoke the next morning, they 
found breakfast ready for both, ate heartily, and having exchanged many 
loving and tender words, they separated, the father riding away. We will 
let him proceed, and see what occurred at the palace.   
Shortly before dinnertime the horse arrived. He came into the room and 
said, "Welcome, Beauty!" She did not feel very glad, and had all she could 
do in keeping her tears back. "You shall do nothing but walk around in 
these rooms and in the garden," continued the horse. "Your meals are 
provided for. I shall come home every day at noon; at other times you must 
not expect me."   
Time passed, and Beauty felt so lonely that she often longed for noon, 
when the horse came home, and she could talk with him. She gradually came 
to look at him more and more kindly; but one thing caused her great 
distress, namely, that she had no news from her father. One day she 
mentioned this to the horse.   
"Yes," said he, "I understand that very well. In the large room you will 
find a mirror in which you can see all that you are thinking of."   
She was happy to learn this, and went straight into the room where the 
mirror was hanging. As soon as she thought of her father, her old home was 
visible in the glass, and she noticed how he was sitting in his chair with 
a sorrowful expression upon his countenance, while his two daughters were 
singing and dancing. Beauty felt sorry over this state of affairs, and the 
next day she told the horse what she had seen.   
"Your father is sorry, I suppose," said the horse, " because he has lost 
you. He will soon feel better, however."   
But on the next day, when Beauty consulted the mirror, her father looked 
pale and ill, like one who is deadly sick; both of her sisters were 
dressed for a ball, and neither of them seemed to care for the weak man. 
Beauty burst into tears, and when the horse came home, asking what ailed 
her, she told him of the bad state of affairs, wishing that he would allow 
her to return and nurse her poor father during his illness.   
"If you will promise to come back," said the horse, "you may return and 
stay for three days; but under no condition must you break your word."   
Beauty told him she would come back in three days.   
"Tonight," resumed the horse, "before going to bed, you must place the 
mirror under your pillow, saying, 'I wish to be home tomorrow.' Then your 
wish will be fulfilled. When you desire to return, you must do likewise." 
  
The next morning, when Beauty awoke, she was at her old home. Her father 
became so glad to see her again that he at once felt a great deal better. 
She cared so well for him that the next day he was able to be up, and on 
the third day he was almost well. As he wished her to stay with him a few 
days longer, she complied, thinking that no harm would come from it. On 
the third day after, however, when she looked into the mirror, she saw the 
horse stretched on the ground in front of the bench which was her favorite 
seat in the garden. She now felt that it would be impossible for her to 
remain longer, hence in the evening, before going to bed, she placed the 
mirror under her pillow, saying: "I wish to be at the palace tomorrow 
morning."   
She promptly awoke in the palace the following morning, and hurrying into 
the garden she found the horse so very sick that he could not stand on his 
legs. Beauty knelt down and asked him to forgive her for staying away 
longer than she had promised. The horse asked her if she could not 
persuade herself to stay with him all her life, but she answered that it 
would seem very singular to live with a horse all her lifetime. The poor 
animal now sighed so deeply that she took pity on him and said, fearing 
that he might die then and there, that she would always stay with him and 
never leave him.   
As soon as she had made this promise, the horse vanished, and a beautiful 
young prince stood before her. He seized her hand and asked whether she 
was not sorry for the promise she had made. No, she said, she would rather 
stay with him now than when he was in the shape of a horse. He now told 
her that both he and the whole land had been enchanted by his wicked 
stepmother, who had converted him into a horse, and told him that only 
when a beautiful young girl would promise to stay with him, in his altered 
shape, would the enchantment be over. He wanted to marry Beauty, and live 
in the palace which belonged to him.   
So they sent for her father to take up his residence with them, and now 
the marriage was performed and celebrated in a splendid manner. They lived 
long and happily together, the prince and his Beauty.
