Once there was a man driving along the road with a pair of mules and a load of pumpkins, when an Irishman stopped him and wanted to know what those things were that he had in his cart.  
The man replied they were mule's eggs, and told the Irishman that if he would put one on the south side of a hill and sit on it, it would hatch out a mule.  
So the Irishman bought one and carried it up on the south side of a hill and sat down on it and soon went to sleep. Of course he fell off, and the pumpkin went rolling over and over down the hill and into the brush; out jumped a rabbit and went running off.  
"Koop, colie! Koop colie! Here's you mammy," called the Irishman, but the rabbit wouldn't stop.  
So the Irishman went back to the other man and said he wanted another mule's egg; the first one hatched into a mighty fine colt, but it ran so fast he couldn't catch it, and he would like to buy another.
