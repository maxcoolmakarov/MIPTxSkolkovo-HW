Once upon a time a little boy was walking down a road. After he had
gone a piece he found a chest. "For sure there is something rare in this
chest," he said to himself. But however he examined it, he found no way to
open it. "That is very strange," he thought. 
 When he had gone on a piece he found a little key. So he stopped and
sat down, and he thought it would be good if the key fit the chest, for
there was a little keyhole in it. So he put the little key into his
pocket. First he blew into the key's shaft. Then he blew into the keyhole.
Then he put the key into the keyhole and turned it around. "Snap!" went
the lock. And then he took hold of the lock, and the chest opened. 
 And can you guess what was in the chest? -- 
 It was a calf's tail. 
 And if the calf's tail had been longer, this tale would have been
longer as well.
