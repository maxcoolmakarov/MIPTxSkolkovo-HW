In Mommenheim a young woman had been buried, and that night the young people who had accompanied her to the grave were now sitting together in the spinning room. The conversation turned to fear, and a girl said to everyone that she was afraid of nothing, whatever it might be.  
The others asked her if right now she dared to go to the graveyard by herself.  
"Why not?" she said. "And to show you that I've been there I'll bring back the cross with the wreath that we set up today on Fränzel's grave."  
The others were amazed at this boldness. And indeed, the girl did go forth without a light and by herself.  
When she failed to return they became ill at ease. A few youths took a lantern and went to the graveyard. There they found the girl sitting on the grave with her hand on the crucifix.  She was dead. Her head had been twisted around her neck.  
   
Note by Stöber: Twisting someone's head around their neck is normally attributed to the devil or the wild huntsman, if one calls on him or if one gives an answer to his call.
