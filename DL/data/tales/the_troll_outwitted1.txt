A husbandman, who had a little mount on his field, resolved not to let it 
lie waste, and began to plow it up. At this the troll, who dwelt in the 
mount, came out and demanded who it was that dared to plow on his roof. 
The husbandman said that he did not know it was his roof, and at the same 
time represented to him that it was disadvantageous for both to let such a 
piece of land lie uncultivated; that he was willing to plow, sow and reap 
every year, and that the troll should alternately have that which in one 
year grew on the earth, and the man that which grew beneath, and the next 
year the reverse. To this the troll agreed, and the man in the first year 
sowed carrots, and in the year following, corn [grain], and gave the troll 
the tops of the carrots and the roots of the corn. From that time there 
was a good understanding between them.
