On a cold frosty day an ant was dragging out some of the corn which he had laid up in summer time, to dry it. A grasshopper, half-perished with hunger, besought the ant to give him a morsel of it to preserve his life.  
"What were you doing," said the ant, "this last summer?"  
"Oh," said the grasshopper, "I was not idle. I kept singing all the summer long."  
Said the ant, laughing and shutting up his granary, "Since you could sing all summer, you may dance all winter."  
 Winter finds out what summer lays by.
