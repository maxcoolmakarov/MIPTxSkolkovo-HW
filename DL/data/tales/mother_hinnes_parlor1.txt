On the way from Westerhausen to Thale, directly behind the village, there is a stone cave in a mountain covered with sandstone cliffs. A wild woman lives there, Mother Hinne. No one knows how she came to be there.  
Some say that she is no longer there, but the children know better, for if they do not behave themselves, one says to them: "Just wait, Mother Hinne is coming now to take you away!"  
That helps a lot, even if they are misbehaving terribly.
