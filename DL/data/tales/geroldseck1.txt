Years ago many stories were told about Geroldseck, an old castle in
Wasgau.  The ancient German heroes -- Kings Ariovist, Hermann, Wittekind,
Siegfried with the horny skin, and many others -- were seen at this castle
at a certain time of the year.  When the Germans were in greatest distress
and facing defeat they would appear with ancient German peoples and come
to their aid.
