There is a lake where every year a virgin is sacrificed. If this does
not happen then the water becomes unruly, the waves grow larger and
larger, then rise higher and higher until they finally flood the entire
land. 
 There is also a city whose citizens have a virgin entombed within a
wall every year. But today no one knows exactly where this is or why it is
done. Some claim that this girl is also a sacrifice to a large lake, which
otherwise would swallow up the city.
