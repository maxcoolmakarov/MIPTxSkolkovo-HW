There are two arches in the middle of the Sachsenh√§user Bridge. At
the top they are closed partially only with wood which, in time of war,
can easily be removed so that the connection can be destroyed without
blasting. The following legend is told about this bridge:
 The builder had agreed to complete the bridge by a certain date. As the
date approached he saw that it would be impossible to meet the deadline.
With only two days remaining, in his fear he called upon the devil and
asked him for help.
 The devil appeared to him and offered to complete the bridge during the
last night if the builder would deliver to him the first living being that
crossed the bridge. The contract was settled, and during the last night
the devil completed the bridge. In the darkness no human eye saw how he
did it.
 At the break of day the builder came and drove a rooster across the
bridge ahead of himself, thus delivering it to the devil. However, the
latter had expected a human soul, and when he saw that he had been
deceived he angrily grabbed the rooster, ripped it apart, and threw it
through the bridge, thus causing the two holes that to the present day
cannot be mortared shut. Any repair work that is completed during the day
just falls apart the next night.
 A golden rooster on an iron bar still stands as the bridge's emblem.
