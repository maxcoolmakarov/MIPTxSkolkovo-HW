A clergyman's wife in Swedish Lappmark, the cleverest midwife in all
Sweden, was summoned one fine summer's evening to attend a mysterious
being of Troll race and great might, called Vitra.  At this unusual call
she took counsel with her husband, who, however, deemed it best for her to
go.  Her guide led her into a splendid building, the rooms whereof were as
clean and elegant as those of very illustrious folk; and in a beautiful
bed lay a still more beautiful woman, for whom her services were required,
and who was no other than Vitra herself.
 Under the midwife's care Vitra speedily gave birth to a fair girl, and
in a few minutes had entirely recovered, and fetched all sorts of
refreshments, which she laid before her benefactress.  The latter refused
to eat, in spite of Vitra's reassuring persuasion, and further refused the
money which the troll-wife pressed upon her.  Vitra then sent her home,
bidding her look on the table when next she entered her cowherd hut and
see what she would find there.  She thought no more of the matter until
the following spring, when on entering the hut she found on the table half
a dozen large spoons of pure silver with her name engraved thereon in neat
letters.
 These spoons long remained an heirloom in the clergyman's family to
testify the truth of the story.
