Once upon a time there was a mother whose only child died. She cried
for it unceasingly. Once she was out in the field and crying again.
Suddenly she saw an entire band of lovely angels flying above her, all of
them young and beautiful, all of them happy and cheerful. Then the mother
thought, "Oh, if only my child were also such a little angel!" And she
looked to see if she could not find her child in the band. But she could
not see it. 
 Then from behind there came a little angel. It was very sad and was
carrying a heavy black jug in its little hands. It was the mother's
child. 
 The mother asked, "My child, why are you not with the happy little
angels?" 
 "Mother," it said, "as long as you are crying I must collect your tears
and cannot be happy like the others." 
 From that hour forth the mother cried no more.
