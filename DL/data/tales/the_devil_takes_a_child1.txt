If one calls on the devil, he will come. This was learned by a woman in Obermiemingen who was more often invoking the devil than God.  
One evening her child would not stop crying, and she said, "Just wait, if you do not be still, the devil will take you away," and she held the child out of the window.  
The child was ripped away from her, and its crying could long be heard from the ever increasing distance. That opened the woman's eyes, and she never again called on the devil.
