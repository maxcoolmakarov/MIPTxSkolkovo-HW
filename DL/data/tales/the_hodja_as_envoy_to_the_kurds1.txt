The Hodja was sent to the Kurds as an envoy. Immediately upon his arrival he was invited to a banquet. He put on his fur coat and went. In the middle of the conversation he suddenly let a fart.
 
They said to him, "It is scandalous to fart like that."  
"What?" he replied. "How was I to know that the Kurds would understand when I farted in Turkish?"
