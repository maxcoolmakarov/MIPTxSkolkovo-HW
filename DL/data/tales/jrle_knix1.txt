In Schmalkalden there once lived a man by the name of Jörle Knix.
During his lifetime he repeatedly encroached upon his neighbors' adjoining
fields by moving the boundary stones, thus dishonestly enlarging his own
lands.
 After his death he was denied eternal peace, and until the present day
Jörle Knix can be seen in his field as a fiery man with his head
under his arm and a glowing hoe on his shoulder.  There, without pause, he
jumps over the boundary stones that he moved.
