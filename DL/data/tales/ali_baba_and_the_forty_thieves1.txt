In days of yore and in times and tides long gone before there
dwelt in a certain town of Persia two brothers one named Kasim
and the other Ali Baba, who at their father's demise had divided
the little wealth he had left to them with equitable division, and
had lost no time in wasting and spending it all. The elder, however,
presently took to himself a wife, the daughter of an opulent
merchant; so that when his father-in-law fared to the mercy of
Almighty Allah, he became owner of a large shop filled with rare
goods and costly wares and of a storehouse stocked with precious
stuffs; likewise of much gold that was buried in the ground. Thus
was he known throughout the city as a substantial man. 
  
But the woman whom Ali Baba had married was poor and needy; they
lived, therefore, in a mean hovel and Ali Baba eked out a scanty
livelihood by the sale of fuel which he daily collected in the jungle
and carried about the town to the Bazar upon his three asses.  
  
Now it chanced one day that Ali Baba had cut dead branches and dry
fuel sufficient for his need, and had placed the load upon his beasts
when suddenly he espied a dust-cloud spireing high in air to his 
right and moving rapidly towards him; and when he closely considered
it he descried a troop of horsemen riding on amain and
about to reach him.  
  
At this sight he was sore alarmed, and fearing
lest perchance they were a band of bandits who would slay him 
and drive off his donkeys, in his affright he began to run; but forasmuch
as they were near hand and he could not escape from out the
forest, he drove his animals laden with the fuel into a bye-way of
the bushes and swarmed up a thick trunk of a huge tree to hide
himself therein; and he sat upon a branch whence he could descry
everything beneath him whilst none below could catch a glimpse
of him above; and that tree grew close beside a rock which
towered high above-head.  
  
The horsemen, young, active, and
doughty riders, came close up to the rock-face and all dismounted;
whereat Ali Baba took good note of them and soon he was fully
persuaded by their mien and demeanour that they were a troop of
highwaymen who, having fallen upon a caravan had despoiled it
and carried off the spoil and brought their booty to this place with
intent of concealing it safely in some cache. Moreover he observed
that they were forty in number.  
  
Ali Baba saw the robbers, as soon as they came under the tree, each unbridle
his horse and hobble it; then all took off their saddle-bags
which proved to be full of gold and silver. The man who
seemed to be the captain presently pushed forwards, load on
shoulder, through thorns and thickets, till he came up to a certain
spot where he uttered these strange words,
"Open, O Simsim I" 
and forthwith appeared a wide doorway in the face of the rock.
  
The robbers went in and last of all their Chief and then the portal
shut of itself. Long while they stayed within the cave whilst Ali
Baba was constrained to abide perched upon the tree, reflecting
that if he came down peradventure the band might issue forth
that very moment and seize him and slay him. At last he had
determined to mount one of the horses and driving on his asses to
return townwards, when suddenly the portal flew open.  
  
The robber-chief was first to issue forth; then, standing at the entrance,
he saw and counted his men as they came out, and lastly he spake
the magical words,
"Shut, O Simsim!" whereat the door closed of
itself. When all had passed muster and review, each slung on his
saddle-bags and bridled his own horse and as soon as ready they rode
off, led by the leader, in the direction whence they came.  
  
Ali Baba
remained still perched on the tree and watched their departure; nor
would he descend until what time they were clean gone out of sight,
lest perchance one of them return and look around and descry him.
  
Then he thought within himself,
"I too will try the virtue of those
magical words and see if at my bidding the door will open and
close."  
  
So he called out aloud,
"Open, O Simsim!"  
  
And no sooner had he spoken than straightway the portal flew open and
he entered within. He saw a large cavern and a vaulted, in height
equalling the stature of a full-grown man and it was hewn in the
live stone and lighted up with light that came through air-holes
and bullseyes in the upper surface of the rock which formed the
roof. He had expected to find naught save outer gloom in this
robbers' den, and he was surprised to see the whole room filled with
bales of all manner stuffs, and heaped up from sole to ceiling with
camel-loads of silks and brocades and embroidered cloths and
mounds on mounds of vari-coloured carpetings; besides which he
espied coins golden and silvern without measure or account, some
piled upon the ground and others bound in leathern bags and
sacks. Seeing these goods and moneys in such abundance, 
Ali Baba determined in his mind that not during a few years only but
for many generations thieves must have stored their gains and
spoils in this place.  
  
When he stood within the cave, its door had
closed upon him, yet he was not dismayed since, he had kept in
memory the magical words; and he took no heed of the precious
stuffs around him, but applied himself only and wholly to the sacks
of Ashrafis. Of these he carried out as many as he judged sufficient
burthen for the beasts; then he loaded them upon his animals,
and covered this plunder with sticks and fuel, so none might
discern the bags, but might think that he was carrying home his
usual ware.  
  
Lastly he called out, "Shut, O Simsim!" and forthwith
the door closed, for the spell so wrought that whensoever any
entered the cave, its portal shut of itself behind him; and, as he
issued therefrom, the same would neither open nor close again till
he had pronounced the words, "Shut, O Simsim!"  
  
Presently, having laden his asses Ali Baba urged them before him with all speed
to the city and reaching home he drove them into the yard; and,
shutting close the outer door, took down first the sticks and fuel
and after the bags of gold which he carried in to his wife.  
  
She felt them and finding them full of coin suspected that Ali Baba had
been robbing and fell to berating and blaming him for that he
should do so ill a thing.  
  
Then quoth Ali Baba to his wife:
"Indeed I am no robber but rather do thou
rejoice with me at our good fortune."  
  
Hereupon he told her of
his adventure and began to pour the gold from the bags in heaps
before her, and her sight was dazzled by the sheen and her heart
delighted at his recital and adventures.  
  
Then she began counting
the gold, whereat quoth Ali Baba,
"O silly woman, how long wilt thou continue turning over the coin? 
Now let me dig a hole wherein
to hide this treasure that none may know its secret."  
  
Quoth she, "Right is thy rede! still would I weigh the moneys and have some
inkling of their amount;" and he replied,
"As thou pleasest, but
see thou tell no man."  
  
So she went off in haste to Kasim's home
to borrow weights and scales wherewith she might balance the
Ashrafis and make some reckoning of their value; and when she
could not find Kaim she said to his wife,
"Lend me, I pray thee,
thy scales for a moment."  
  
Replied her sister-in-law, "Hast thou
need of the bigger balance or the smaller?" and the other
rejoined, "I need not the large scales, give me the little;" and
her sister-in-law cried,
"Stay here a moment whilst I look about
and find thy want."  
  
With this pretext Kasim's wife went aside
and secretly smeared wax and suet over the pan of the balance,
that she might know what thing it was Ali Baba's wife would
weigh, for she made sure that whatso it be some bit thereof would
stick to the wax and fat. So the woman took this opportunity to
satisfy her curiosity, and Ali Baba's wife suspecting naught thereof
carried home the scales and began to weigh the gold, whilst Ali
Baba ceased not digging; and, when the money was weighed,
they twain stowed it into the hole which they carefully filled up
with earth.  
  
Then the good wife took back the scales to her
kinswoman, all unknowing that an Ashrafi had adhered to the
cup of the scales; but when Kasim's wife espied the gold coin
she fumed with envy and wrath, saying to herself,
"So ho! they
borrowed my balance to weigh out Ashrafis?" and she marvelled
greatly whence so poor a man as Ali Baba had gotten such store
of wealth that he should be obliged to weigh it with a pair of
scales.  
  
Now after long pondering the matter, when her husband 
returned home at eventide, she said to him,
"O man, thou deemest
thyself a wight of wealth and substance, but lo, thy brother Ali
Baba is an Emir by the side of thee and richer far than thou art.
He hath such heaps of gold that he must needs weigh his moneys
with scales, whilst thou, forsooth, art satisfied to count thy coin."
  
"Whence knowe'st thou this?" asked Kasim, and in answer his
wife related all anent the pair of scales and how she found an
Ashrafi stuck to them, and shewed him the gold coin which bore
the mark and superscription of some ancient king.  
  
No sleep had Kasim all that night by reason of his envy and jealousy and
covetise; and next morning he rose betimes and going to Ali
Baba said,
"O my brother, to all appearance thou art poor and
needy; but in effect thou hast a store of wealth so abundant
that perforce thou must weigh thy gold with scales."  
  
Quoth Ali Baba,
"What is this thou sayest? I understand thee not; make
clear thy purport;" and quoth Kasim with ready rage,
"Feign not
that thou art ignorant of what I say and think not to deceive me."
 
  
Then showing him the Ashrafi he cried,
"Thousands of gold coins
such as these thou hast put by; and meanwhile my wife found
this one stuck to the cup of the scales."  
  
Then Ali Baba understood
how both Kasim and his wife knew that he had store of
Ashrafis, and said in his mind that it would not avail him to keep
the matter hidden, but would rather cause ill-will and mischief;
and thus he was induced to tell his brother every whit concerning
the bandits and also of the treasure trove in the cave.  
  
When he had heard the story, Kasim exclaimed,
"I would fain learn of thee the certainty of the place where them foundest the moneys; 
also the magical words whereby the door opened and closed; and I
forewarn thee an thou tell me not the whole truth, I will give
notice of those Ashrafis to the Wali;
then shalt thou forfeit all
thy wealth and be disgraced and thrown into gaol."  
  
Thereupon
Ali Baba told him his tale not forgetting the magical words; and
Kasim who kept careful heed of all these matters next day set out,
driving ten mules he had hired, and readily found the place which
Ali Baba had described to him. And when he came to the aforesaid
rock and to the tree whereon Ali Baba had hidden himself,
and he had made sure of the door he cried in great joy,
"Open, O Simsim!"  
  
The portal yawned wide at once and Kasim went
within and saw the piles of jewels and treasures lying ranged all
around; and, as soon as he stood amongst them the door shut
after him as wont to do. He walked about in ecstasy marvelling
at the treasures, and when weary of admiration he gathered
together bags of Ashrafis, a sufficient load for his ten mules, and
placed them by the entrance in readiness to be carried outside and
set upon the beasts. But by the will of Allah Almighty he had
clean forgotten the cabalistic words and cried out, "Open, O
Barley!" whereat the door refused to move.  
  
Astonished and confused
beyond measure he named the names of all manner of grains
save sesame, which had slipped from his memory as though he had
never heard the word; whereat in his dire distress he heeded not the
Ashrafis that lay heaped at the entrance and paced to and fro,
backwards and forwards, within the cave sorely puzzled and perplexed.
The wealth whose sight had erewhile filled his heart with
joy and gladness was now the cause of bitter grief and sadness. 
  
Kasini gave up all hope of the life which he by his greed and envy had
so sore imperilled.  
  
It came to pass that at noontide the robbers,
returning by that way, saw from afar some mules standing beside the
entrance and much they marvelled at what had brought the beasts
to that place; for, inasmuch as Kasim by mischance had failed to
tether or hobble them, they had strayed about the jungle and were
browsing hither and thither. However, the thieves paid scant
regard to the estrays nor cared they to secure them, but only
wondered by what means they had wandered so far from the
town.  
  
Then, reaching the cave the Captain and his troop dismounted
and going up to the door repeated the formula and at
once it flew open. Now Kasim had heard from within the cave
the horse-hooves drawing nigh and yet nigher; and he fell down
to the ground in a fit of fear never doubting that it was the clatter
of the banditti who would slaughter him without fail. Howbeit he
presently took heart of grace and at the moment when the door
flew open he rushed out hoping to make good his escape. But the
unhappy ran full tilt against the Captain who stood in front of the
band, and felled him to the ground; whereupon a robber standing
near his chief at once bared his brand and with one cut clave Kasim
clean in twain.  
  
Thereupon the robbers rushed into the cavern, and
put back as they were before the bags of Ashrafis which Kasim
had heaped up at the doorway ready for taking away; nor recked
they aught of those which Ali Baba had removed, so dazed and
amazed were they to discover by what means the strange man had
effected an entrance. All knew that it was not possible for any to
drop through the skylights so tall and steep was the rock's face,
withal slippery of ascent; and also that none could enter by the
portal unless he knew the magical words whereby to open it.
  
However they presently quartered the dead body of Kasim 
and hung it to the door within the cavern, two parts to the right jamb
and as many to the left that the sight might be a warning of
approaching doom for all who dared enter the cave. Then coming
out they closed the hoard door and rode away upon their wonted
work.  
  
Now when night fell and Kasim came not home, his wife
waxed uneasy in mind and running round to Ali Baba said,
"O my brother, Kasim hath not returned: thou knowest whither he
went, and sore I fear me some misfortune hath betided him."  
  
Ali Baba also divined that a mishap had happened to prevent his
return; not the less, however, he strove to comfort his sister-in-law
with words of cheer and said,
"O wife of my brother, Kasim haply
exerciseth discretion and, avoiding the city, cometh by a roundabout
road and will be here anon. This, I do believe, is the reason
why he tarrieth."  
  
Thereupon comforted in spirit Kasim's wife
fared homewards and sat awaiting her husband's return; but when
half the night was spent and still he came not, she was as one
distraught. She feared to cry aloud for her grief, lest haply the
neighbours hearing her should come and learn the secret; so she
wept in silence and upbraiding herself fell to thinking,
"Wherefore did I disclose this secret to him and beget envy and jealousy of
Ali Baba? this be the fruit thereof and hence the disaster that hath
come down upon me."  
  
She spent the rest of the night in bitter
tears and early on the morrow hied in hottest hurry to Ali Baba
and prayed that he would go forth in quest of his brother; so he
strove to console her and straightway set out with his asses for the
forest. Presently, reaching the rock he wondered to see stains of
blood freshly shed and not finding his brother or the ten mules he
forefelt a calamity from so evil a sign.  
  
He then went to the door and saving,
"Open, O Simsim!" he pushed in and saw the
dead body of Kasim, two parts hanging to the right, 
and the rest to the left of the entrance. Albeit he was affrighted beyond
measure of affright he wrapped the quarters in two cloths and laid
them upon one of his asses, hiding them carefully with sticks and
fuel that none might see them. Then he placed the bags of gold
upon the two other animals and likewise covered them most
carefully; and, when all was made ready he closed the cave-door
with the magical words, and set him forth wending homewards with
all ward and watchfulness.  
  
The asses with the load of Ashrafis he
made over to his wife and bade her bury the bags with diligence;
but he told her not the condition in which he had come upon his
brother Kasim, Then he went with the other ass, to wit, the beast
whereon was laid the corpse to the widow's house and knocked
gently at the door.  
  
Now Kasim had a slave-girl shrewd and
sharp-witted, Morgiana hight. She as softly undid the bolt and
admitted Ali Baba and the ass into the courtyard of the house,
when he let down the body from the beast's back and said,
"O Morgiana, haste thee and make thee ready to perform the rites for
the burial of thy lord: I now go to tell the tidings to thy mistress
and I will quickly return to help thee in this matter."  
  
At that instant Kasim's widow seeing her brother-in-law, exclaimed,
"O
Ali Baba, what news bringest thou of my spouse? Alas, I see
grief tokens written upon thy countenance. Say quickly what
hath happened."  
  
Then he recounted to her how it had fared with
her husband and how he had been slain by the robbers and in what
wise he had brought home the dead body. 
  
Ali Baba pursued:
"O my lady, what was to happen hath happened, but it behoveth us to 
keep this matter secret, for that our lives
depend upon privacy."  
  
She wept with sore weeping and made answer,
"It hath fared with my husband according to the fiat of
Fate; and now for thy safety's sake I give thee my word to keep
the affair concealed."  
  
He replied, "Naught can avail when Allah
hath decreed. Rest thee in patience; until the days of thy
widowhood be accomplisht; after which time I will take thee to
wife, and thou shalt live in comfort and happiness; and fear not
lest my first spouse vex thee or show aught of jealousy, for that
she is kindly and tender of heart."  
  
The widow lamenting her loss noisily, cried,
"Be it as e'en thou please."  
  
Then Ali Baba farewelled her, weeping and wailing for her husband; 
and joining Morgiana took counsel with her how to manage the burial 
of his brother. So, after much consultation and many warnings, 
he left the slave-girl and departed home driving his ass before him.  
  
As soon as Ali Baba had fared forth Morgiana went quickly to a
druggist's shop; and, that she might the better dissemble with
him and not make known the matter, she asked of him a drug
often administered to men when diseased with dangerous distemper.
  
He gave it saying, "Who is there in thy house that lieth so ill as
to require this medicine?" and said she, "My Master Kasim is
sick well nigh unto death: for many days he hath nor spoken nor
tasted aught of food, so that almost we despair of his life."  
  
Next day Morgiana went again and asked the druggist for more of
medicine and essences such as are adhibited to the sick when at
door of death, that the moribund may haply rally before the
last breath.  
  
The man gave the potion and she taking it sighed
aloud and wept, saying, "I fear me he may not have strength to
drink this draught: methinks all will be over with him ere I return
to the house."  
  
Meanwhile Ali Baba was anxiously awaiting to
hear sounds of wailing and lamentation in Kasim's home that he might at 
such signal hasten thither and take part in the ceremonies
of the funeral. Early on the second day Morgiana went with
veiled face to one Baba Mustafa, a tailor well shotten in years
whose craft was to make shrouds and cerecloths; and as soon as
she saw him open his shop she gave him a gold piece and said,
"Do thou bind a bandage over thine eyes and come along with
me."  
  
Mustafa made as though he would not go, whereat
Morgiana placed a second gold coin in his palm and entreated
him to accompany her. The tailor presently consented for greed
of gain, so tying a kerchief tightly over his eyes she led him by
the hand to the house wherein lay the dead body of her master.
 
  
Then, taking off the bandage in the darkened room she bade him
sew together the quarters of the corpse, limb to its limb; and, casting
a cloth upon the body, said to the tailor,
"Make haste and sew a shroud according to the size of this dead man 
and I will give thee therefor yet another ducat."  
  
Baba Mustafa quickly made the
cere cloth of fitting length and breadth, and Morgiana paid him
the promised Ashrafi; then once more bandaging his eyes led him
back to the place whence she had brought him. After this she
returned hurriedly home and with the help of Ali Baba washed
the body, in warm water and donning the shroud lay the corpse
upon a clean place ready for burial.  
  
This done Morgiana went
to the mosque and gave notice to an Imam that a funeral was
awaiting the mourners in a certain household, and prayed that he
would come to read the prayers for the dead; and the Imam went
back with her. Then four neighbours took up the bier and bore it 
on tneir shoulders and fared forth with the Imam and others
who were wont to give assistance at such obsequies. After the
funeral prayers were ended four other men carried off the coffin;
and Morgiana walked before it bare of head, striking her breast
and weeping and wailing with exceeding loud lament, whilst Ali
Baba and the neighbours came behind. 
  
In such order they
entered the cemetery and buried him; then, leaving him to Munkar
and Nakir -- the Questioners of the Dead -- all wended their ways.
 
  
Presently the women of the quarter, according to the custom of the
city, gathered together in the house of mourning and sat an hour
with Kasim's widow comforting and condoling, presently leaving
her somewhat resigned and cheered. Ali Baba stayed forty days
at home in ceremonial lamentation for the loss of his brother; so
none within the town save himself and his wife (Kasim's widow)
and Morgiana knew aught about the secret. And when the forty
days of mourning were ended Ali Baba removed to his own
quarters all the property belonging to the deceased and openly
married the widow; then he appointed his nephew, his brother's
eldest son, who had lived a long time with a wealthy merchant
and was perfect of knowledge in all matters of trade, such as selling
and buying, to take charge of the defunct's shop and to carry on
the business. 
  
It so chanced
one day when the robbers, as was their wont, came to the treasurecave
that they marvelled exceedingly to find nor sign nor trace of
Kasim's body whilst they observed that much of gold had been
carried off.  
  
Quoth the Captain,
"Now it behoveth us to make enquiry in this matter; else shall 
we suffer much of loss arid this
our treasure, which we and our forefathers have amassed during
the course of many years, will little by little be wasted and
spoiled."  
  
Hereto all assented and with single mind agreed that
he whom they had slain had knowledge of the magical words
whereby the door was made to open; moreover that some one
beside him had cognizance of the spell and had carried off the
body, and also much of gold; wherefore they needs must make
diligent research and find out who the man ever might be. They
then took counsel and determined that one amongst them, who
should be sagacious and deft of wit, must don the dress of some
merchant from foreign parts; then, repairing to the city he must
go about from quarter to quarter and from street to street, and
learn if any townsman had lately died and if so where he wont to
dwell, that with this clue they might be enabled to find the wight
they sought.  
  
Hereat said one of the robbers,
"Grant me leave
that I fare and find out such tidings in the town and bring thee
word anon; and if I fail of my purpose I hold my life in forfeit."
  
Accordingly that bandit, after disguising himself by dress, pushed
at night into the town and next morning early he repaired to the
market-square and saw that none of the shops had yet been opened,
save only that of Baba Mustafa the tailor, who thread and needle
in hand sat upon his working-stool.  
  
The thief bade him good day and said,
"'Tis yet dark: how canst thou see to sew?" 
  
Said the tailor, "I perceive thou art a stranger. Despite my years my
eyesight is so keen that only yesterday I sewed together a dead
body whilst sitting in a room quite darkened."  
  
Quoth the bandit thereupon to himself, "I shall get somewhat of my want from this
snip;" and to secure a further clue he asked,
"Meseemeth thou wouldst jest with me and thou meanest that a cerecloth for a
corpse was stitched by thee and that thy business is to sew
shrouds."  
  
Answered the tailor, "It mattereth not to thee: question
me no more questions."  
  
Thereupon the robber placed an Ashrafi in his hand and continued,
"I desire not to discover aught thou
hidest, albeit my breast like every honest man's is the grave of
secrets; and this only would I learn of thee, in what house didst
thou do that job? Canst thou direct me thither, or thyself
conduct me thereto?"  
  
The tailor took the gold with greed and
cried, "I have not seen with my own eyes the way to that house.
A certain bondswoman led me to a place which I know right well
and there she bandaged my eyes and guided me to some tenement
and lastly carried me into a darkened room where lay the dead
body dismembered. Then she unbound the kerchief and bade me
sew together first the corpse and then the shroud, which having
done she again blindfolded me and led me back to the stead
whence she had brought me and left me there. Thou seest then I
am not able to tell thee where thou shalt find the house."  
  
Quoth the robber, "Albeit thou knowest not the dwelling whereof thou
speakest, still canst thou take me to the place where thou wast
blindfolded; then I will bind a kerchief over thine eyes and lead
thee as thou wast led: on this wise perchance thou mayest hit
upon the site. An thou wilt do this favour by me, see here
another golden ducat is thine."  
  
Thereupon the bandit slipped a
second Ashrafi into the tailor's palm, and Baba Mustafa thrust it
with the first into his pocket; then, leaving his shop as it was, he
walked to the place where Morgiana had tied the kerchief around
his eyes, and with him went the robber who, after binding on the
bandage, led him by the hand.  
  
Baba Mustafa, who was clever and
keen-witted, presently striking the street whereby he had fared
with the handmaid, walked on counting step by step; then, halting
suddenly, he said, "Thus far I came with her;" and the twain
stopped in front of Kasim's house wherein now dwelt his brother
Ali Baba.  
  
The robber then made marks with white chalk upon the door to the
end that he might readily find it at some future time, and
removing the bandage from the tailor's eyes said, "O Baba
Mustafa, I thank thee for this favour: and Almighty Allah
guerdon thee for thy goodness. Tell me now, I pray thee, who
dwelleth in yonder house?" 
  
Quoth he,
"In very sooth I wot not,
for I have little knowledge concerning this quarter of the city;"
and the bandit, understanding that he could find no further clue
from the tailor, dismissed him to his shop with abundant thanks,
and hastened back to the tryst-place in the jungle where the band
awaited his coming.  
  
Not long after it so fortuned that Morgiana,
going out upon some errand, marvelled exceedingly at seeing
the chalk-marks showing white in the door; she stood awhile
deep in thought and presently divined that some enemy had made
the signs that he might recognize the house and play some sleight
upon her lord. She therefore chalked the doors of all her
neighbours in like manner and kept the matter secret, never
entrusting it or to master or to mistress.  
  
Meanwhile the robber
told his comrades his tale of adventure and how he had found
the clue; so the Captain and with him all the band went one
after other by different ways till they entered the city ; and he
who had placed the mark on Ali Baba's door accompanied the
Chief to point out the place. He conducted him straightway
to the house and shewing the sign exclaimed,
"Here dwelleth he of whom we are in search!"  
  
But when the Captain looked
around him he saw that all the dwellings bore chalk-marks after
like fashion and he wondered saying,
"By what manner of means
knowest thou which house of all these houses that bear similar
signs is that whereof thou spakest?"  
  
Hereat the robber-guide was confounded beyond measure of confusion, 
and could make no answer; then with an oath he cried,
"I did assuredly set a sign
upon a door, but I know not whence came all the marks upon
the other entrances; nor can I say for a surety which it was I
chalked."  
  
Thereupon the Captain returned to the market-place
and said to his men,
"We have toiled and laboured in vain, nor
have we found the house we went forth to seek. Return we now
to the forest our rendezvous: I also will fare thither."  
  
Then all trooped off and assembled together within the treasure-cave; 
and, when the robbers had all met, the Captain judged him worthy
of punishment who had spoken falsely and had led them through
the city to no purpose. So he imprisoned him in presence of
them all; and then said he,
"To him amongst you will I show special
favour who shall go to town and bring me intelligence
whereby we may lay hands upon the plunderer of our property."
  
Hereat another of the company came forward and said,
"I am ready to go and enquire into the case, and 'tis I who will bring
thee to thy wish."  
  
The Captain after giving him presents and
promises despatched him upon his errand; and by the decree
of Destiny which none may gainsay, this second robber went
first to the house of Baba Mustafa the tailor, as had done the
thief who had foregone him. In like manner he also persuaded
the snip with gifts of golden coin that he be led hoodwinked
and thus too he was guided to Ali Baba's door. Here noting
the work of his predecessor, he affixed to the jamb a mark with
red chalk the better to distinguish it from the others whereon
still showed the white. Then hied he back in stealth to his
company; but Morgiana on her part also descried the red
sign on the entrance and with subtle forethought marked all
the others after the same fashion; nor told she any what she
had done.  
  
Meanwhile the bandit rejoined his band and vauntingly said,
"O our Captain, I have found the house and thereon put a
mark whereby I shall distinguish it clearly from all its neighbours."  
  
The Captain despatched another of his men to the city and he found
the place, but, as aforetime, when the troop repaired thither they
saw each and every house marked with signs of red chalk. So
they returned disappointed and the Captain, waxing displeased
exceedingly and distraught, clapped also this spy into gaol.
  
Then said the chief to himself, "Two men have failed in their
endeavour and have met their rightful meed of punishment; and
I trow that none other of my band will essay to follow up their
research; so I myself will go and find the house of this wight."
  
Accordingly he fared along and aided by the tailor Baba Mustafa,
who had gained much gain of golden pieces in this matter, he
hit upon the house of Ali Baba; and here he made no outward
show or sign, but marked it on the tablet of his heart and
impressed the picture upon the page of his memory.  
  
Then returning to the jungle he said to his men, "I have full cognizance
of the place and have limned it clearly in my mind ; so
now there will be no difficulty in finding it. Go forth straightways
and buy me and bring hither nineteen mules together with
one large leathern jar of mustard oil and seven and thirty vessels
of the same kind clean empty. Without me and the two locked
up in gaol ye number thirty-seven souls; so I will stow you
away armed and accoutred each within his jar and will load
two upon each mule, and upon the nineteenth mule there shall
be a man in an empty jar on one side, and on the other the
jar full of oil. I for my part, in guise of an oil-merchant, 
will drive the mules into the town, arriving at the house by night,
and will ask permission of its master to tarry there until morning.
After this we shall seek occasion during the dark hours to rise
up and fall upon him and slay him."  
  
Furthermore the Captain spake saying, "When we have made an end of trim we shall
recover the gold and treasure whereof he robbed us and bring it
back upon the mules."  
  
This counsel pleased the robbers who
went forthwith and purchased mules and huge leathern jars, and
did as the Captain had bidden them. And after a delay of
three days shortly before nightfall they arose; and over-smearing
all the jars with oil of mustard, each hid him inside an empty
vessel. The Chief then disguised himself in trader's gear and
placed the jars upon the nineteen mules; to wit, the thirty-seven
vessels in each of which lay a robber armed and accoutred, and
the one that was full of oil. This done, he drove the beasts
before him and presently he reached Ali Baba's place at nightfall;
when it chanced that the house-master was strolling after
supper to and fro in front of his home.  
  
The Captain saluted him with the salam and said,
"I come from such and such a
village with oil; and ofttimes have I been here a-selling oil, but
now to my grief I have arrived too late and I am sore troubled
and perplexed as to where I shall spend the night. An thou
have pity on me I pray thee grant that I tarry here in thy courtyard
and ease the mules by taking down the jars and giving the
beasts somewhat of fodder."  
  
Albeit Ali Baba had heard the
Captain's voice when perched upon the tree and had seen him
enter the cave, yet by reason of the disguise he knew him not
for the leader of the thieves, and granted his request with hearty
welcome and gave him full license to halt there for the night.
He then pointed out an empty shed wherein to tether the mules,
and bade one of the slave-boys go fetch grain and water. He
also gave orders to the slave-girl Morgiana saying, "A guest
hath come hither and tarrieth here to-night. 
Do thou busy thyself with all speed about his supper and make ready the guestbed
for him."  
  
Presently, when the Captain had let down all the
jars and had fed and watered his mules, Ali Baba received him
with all courtesy and kindness, and summoning Morgiana said in
his presence,
"See thou fail not in service of this our stranger
nor suffer him to lack for aught. To-morrow early I would fare
to the Hammam and bathe; so do thou give my slave-boy Abdullah
a suit of clean white clothes which I may put on after washing;
moreover make thee ready a somewhat of broth overnight that
I may drink it after my return home." 
 
  
Replied she, "I will have all in readiness as thou hast bidden." 
 
  
So Ali Baba retired
to his rest, and the Captain, having supped, repaired to the shed
and saw that all the mules had their food and drink for the
night.  
  
The Captain, after seeing to the mules and the jars which Ali Baba and his
household held to be full of oil, finding utter privacy, whispered to his
men who were in ambush,
"This night at midnight when ye hear
my voice, do you quickly open with your sharp knives the leathern
jars from top to bottom and issue forth without delay."  
  
Then passing through the kitchen he reached the chamber wherein a bed
had been dispread for him, Morgiana showing the way with a
lamp.  
  
Quoth she, "An thou need aught beside I pray thee command
this thy slave who is ever ready to obey thy say!"  
  
He made answer, "Naught else need I;" then, putting out the light,
he lay him down on the bed to sleep awhile ere the time came to
rouse his men and finish off the work.  
  
Meanwhile Morgiana did as her master had bidden her: 
she first took out a suit of clean
white clothes and made it over to Abdullah who had not yet gone to rest; 
then she placed the pipkin upon the hearth to boil the
broth and blew the fire till it burnt briskly. After a short delay
she needs must see an the broth be boiling, but by that time all
the lamps had gone out and she found that the oil was spent and
that nowhere could she get a light.  
  
The slave-boy Abdullah observed that she was troubled and perplexed hereat, 
and quoth he to her, "Why make so much ado? In yonder shed are many
jars of oil: go now and take as much soever as thou listest."
  
Morgiana gave thanks to him for his suggestion; and Abdullah,
who was lying at his ease in the hall, went off to sleep so that he
might wake betimes and serve Ali Baba in the bath.  
  
So the handmaiden rose and with oil-can in hand walked to the shed where
stood the leathern jars all ranged in rows. Now, as she drew nigh
unto one of the vessels, the thief who was hidden therein hearing
the tread of footsteps bethought him that it was of his Captain
whose summons he awaited; so he whispered,
"Is it now time for us to sally forth?"
  
Morgiana started back affrighted at the sound
of human accents; but, inasmuch as she was bold and ready of
wit, she replied, "The time is not yet come," and said to herself,
"These jars are not full of oil and herein I perceive a manner of
mystery. Haply the oil merchant hatcheth some treacherous plot
against my lord; so Allah, the Compassionating, the Compassionate,
protect us from his snares!"  
  
Wherefore she answered in a
voice made like to the Captain's,
"Not yet, the time is not come."  
  
Then she went to the next jar and returned the same
reply to him who was within, and so on to all the vessels one by
one. Then said she in herself,
"Laud to the Lord! my master
took this fellow in believing him to be an oil-merchant, but lo, he
hath admitted a band of robbers, who only await the signal to fall 
upon him and plunder the place and do him die."  
  
Then passed she on to the furthest jar and finding it brimming with oil, filled
her can, and returning to the kitchen, trimmed the lamp and lit
the wicks; then, bringing forth a large cauldron, she set it upon
the fire, and filling it with oil from out the jar heaped wood upon
the hearth and fanned it to a fierce flame the readier to boil its
contents. When this was done she baled it out in potfuls and
poured it seething hot into the leathern vessels one by one while
the thieves unable to escape were scalded to death and every jar
contained a corpse.
  
Thus did this slave-girl by her subtle wit
make a clean end of all noiselessly and unknown even to the
dwellers m the house. Now when she had satisfied herself that
each and every of the men had been slain, she went back to the
kitchen and shutting to the door sat brewing Ali Baba's broth.
  
Scarce had an hour passed before the Captain woke from sleep;
and, opening wide his window, saw that all was dark and silent;
so he clapped his hands as a signal for his men to come forth but
not a sound was heard in return. After awhile he clapped again
and called aloud but got no answer; and when he cried out a third
time without reply he was perplexed and went out to the shed
wherein stood the jars.  
  
He thought to himself,
"Perchance all are fallen asleep whenas the time for action is now at hand, 
so I must e'en awaken them without stay or delay."  
  
Then approaching
the nearest jar he was startled by a smell of oil and seething
flesh; and touching it outside he felt it reeking hot; then going
to the others one by one, he found all in like condition. Hereat
he knew for a surety the fate which had betided his band and,
fearing for his own safety, he clomb on to the wall, and thence
dropping into a garden made his escape in high dudgeon and sore disappointment.  
  
Morgiana awaited awhile to see the Captain
return from the shed but he came not; whereat she knew that he
had scaled the wall and had taken to flight, for that the street-door
was double-locked; and the thieves being all disposed of on this
wise Morgiana laid her down to sleep in perfect solace and ease
of mind.  
  
When two hours of darkness yet remained, Ali Baba
awoke and went to the Hammam knowing naught of the night-adventure,
for the gallant slave-girl had not aroused him, nor
indeed had she deemed such action expedient, because had she
sought an opportunity of reporting to him her plan, she might
haply have lost her chance and spoiled the project.  
  
The sun was high over the horizon when Ali Baba walked back from the Baths;
and he marvelled exceedingly to see the jars still standing under
the shed and said, "How cometh it that he, the oil-merchant my
guest, hath not carried to the market his mules and jars of
oil?" 
  
Ali Baba presently asked Morgiana what had befallen the oil-merchant
his guest whom he had placed under her charge; and she answered,
"Allah Almighty vouchsafe to thee six score years and ten of
safety! I will tell thee in privacy of this merchant."  
  
So Ali Baba went apart with his slave-girl, who taking him without the
house first locked the court-door; then showing him a jar she said,
"Prithee look into this and see if within there be oil or aught else."
  
Thereupon peering inside it he perceived a man at which sight he
cried aloud and fain would have fled in his fright.  
  
Quoth Morgiana, "Fear him not, this man hath no longer the force to work thee
harm, he lieth dead and stone-dead."  
  
Hearing such words of comfort and reassurance Ali Baba asked,
"O Morgiana, what evils
have we escaped and by what means hath this wretch become the quarry of Fate?"  
  
She answered "Alhamdolillah -- Praise be to
Almighty Allah! -- I will inform thee fully of the case; but hush
thee, speak not aloud, lest haply the neighbours learn the secret
and it end in our confusion. Look now into all the jars, one
by one from first to last."  
  
So Ali Baba examined them severally
and found in each a man fully armed and accoutred and all
lay scalded to death. Hereat speechless for sheer amazement
he stared at the jars, but presently recovering himself he asked,
"And where is he, the oil-merchant?"  
  
Answered she, "Of him also I will inform thee. The villain was no trader but a traitorous
assassin whose honied words would have ensnared thee to thy
doom; and now I will tell thee what he was and what hath
happened; but, meanwhile thou art fresh from the Hammam and
thou shouldst first drink somewhat of this broth for thy stomach's
and thy health's sake."  
  
So Ali Baba went within and Morgiana
served up the mess; after which quoth her master,
"I fain would hear this wondrous story: prithee tell it to me and set my heart at
ease."  
  
Hereat the handmaid fell to relating whatso had betided
in these words: 
 
O my master, when thou badest me boil the
broth and retiredst to rest, thy slave in obedience to thy command
took out a suit of clean white clothes and gave it to the boy
Abdullah; then kindled the fire and set on the broth. As soon as
it was ready I had need to light a lamp so that I might see to
skim it, but all the oil was spent, and, learning this I told my want
to the slave-boy Abdullah, who advised me to draw somewhat
from the jars which stood under the shed.  
  
Accordingly, I took a
can and went to the first vessel when suddenly I heard a voice
within whisper with all caution,
"Is it now time for us to sally
forth?"
  
I was amazed thereat and judged that the pretended
merchant had laid some plot to slay thee; so I replied,
"The time is not yet come."  
  
Then I went to the second jar and heard another
voice to which I made the like answer, and so on with all of them.
I now was certified that these men awaited only some signal from 
their Chief whom thou didst take to guest within thy walls supposing
him to be a merchant in oil; and that after thou receivedst
him hospitably the miscreant had brought these men to murther
thee and to plunder thy good and spoil thy house. But I gave
him no opportunity to win his wish.  
  
The last jar I found full of
oil and taking somewhat therefrom I lit the lamp; then, putting a
large cauldron upon the fire, I filled it up with oil which I brought
from the jar and made a fierce blaze under it; and, when the contents
were seething hot, I took out sundry cansful with intent to
scald them all to death, and going to each jar in due order, I
poured within them one by one boiling oil. On this wise having
destroyed them utterly, I returned to the kitchen and having
extinguished the lamps stood by the window watching what might
happen, and how that false merchant would act next.  
  
Not long after I had taken my station, the robber-captain awoke and ofttimes
signalled to his thieves. Then getting no reply he came
downstairs and went out to the jars, and finding that all his men
were slain he fled through the darkness I know not whither.  
  
So when he had clean disappeared I was assured that, the door
being double-locked, he had scaled the wall and dropped into the
garden and made his escape. Then with my heart at rest I slept.
 
And Morgiana, after telling her story to her master, presently added,
"This is the whole truth I have related to thee. For some days
indeed have I had inkling of such matter, but withheld it from
thee deeming it inexpedient to risk the chance of its meeting the
neighbours' ears; now, however, there is no help but to tell thee
thereof. One day as I came to the house-door I espied thereon a
white chalk-mark, and on the next day a red sign beside the white.
I knew not the intent wherewith the marks were made, nevertheless
I set others upon the entrances of sundry neighbours,
judging that some enemy had done this deed whereby to encompass
my master's destruction. Therefore I made the marks on all the
other doors in such perfect conformity with those I found, 
that it would be hard to distinguish amongst them." 
  
Morgiana continued to Ali Baba: "Judge now and see if these signs and
all this villainy be not the work of the bandits of the forest,
who marked our house that on such wise they might know it
again. Of these forty thieves there yet remain two others concerning
whose case I know naught; so beware of them, but
chiefly of the third remaining robber, their Captain, who fled hence
alive. Take good heed and be thou cautious of him, for, shouldst
thou fall into his hands, he will in no wise spare thee but will
surely murther thee. I will do all that lieth in me to save
from hurt and harm thy life and property, nor shall thy slave be
found wanting in any service to my lord."  
  
Hearing these words
Ali Baba rejoiced with exceeding joyance and said to her, "I
am well pleased with thee for this thy conduct ; and say me
what wouldst thou have me do in thy behalf; I shall not fail
to remember thy brave deed so long as breath in me remaineth."
  
Quoth she, "It behoveth us before all things forthright to bury
these bodies in the ground, that so the secret be not known to
any one."  
  
Hereupon Ali Baba took with him his slave-boy
Abdullah into the garden and there under a tree they dug for
the corpses of the thieves a deep pit in size proportionate to its
conterits, and they dragged, the bodies (having carried off their
weapons) to the fosse and threw them in; then, covering up
the remains of the seven and thirty robbers they made the
ground appear level and clean as it wont to be. They also hid the
leathern jars and the gear and arms and presently Ali Baba sent
the mules by ones and twos to the bazar and sold them all
with the able aid of his slave-boy Abdullah.  
  
Thus the matter wras hushed up nor did it reach the ears of any; 
however, Ali Baba ceased not to be ill at ease lest haply the Captain 
or the surviving two robbers should wreak their vengeance on his head.
He kept himself private with all caution and took heed that
none learn a word of what had happened and of the wealth
which he had carried off from the bandits' cave.  
  
Meanwhile the Captain of the thieves having escaped with his life, fled to the
forest in hot wrath and sore irk of mind; and his senses were
scattered and the colour of his visage vanished like ascending
smoke. Then he thought the matter over again and again, and
at last he firmly resolved that he needs must take the life of Ali
Baba, else he would lose all the treasure which his enemy, by
knowledge of the magical words, would take away and turn to
his own use. Furthermore, he determined that he would undertake
the business single-handed; and, that after getting rid of
Ali Baba, he would gather together another band of banditti
and would pursue his career of brigandage, as indeed his forbears
had done for many generations.  
  
So he lay down to rest that
night, and rising early in the morning donned a dress of suitable
appearance; then going to the city alighted at a caravanserai,
thinking to himself, "Doubtless the murther of so many men hath
reached the Wali's ears, and Ali Baba hath been seized and
brought to justice, and his house is levelled and his good is confiscated.
The townfolk must surely have heard tidings of these
matters."  
  
So he straightway asked of the keeper of the Khan,
"What strange things have happened in the city during the last
few days?" and the other told him all that he had seen and heard,
but the Captain could not learn a whit of that which most concerned
him.  
  
Hereby he understood that Ali Baba was ware and
wise, and that he had not only carried away such store of treasure
but he had also destroyed so many lives and withal had come off
scatheless; furthermore, that he himself must needs have all his
wits alert not to fall into the hands of his foe and perish. 
  
With this resolve the Captain hired a shop in the Bazar, whither he
bore whole bales of the finest stuffs and goodly merchandise from
his forest treasure-house; and presently he took his seat within
the store and fell to doing merchant's business. By chance his place
fronted the booth of the defunct Kasim where his son, Ali Baba's
nephew, now traded; and the Captain, who called himself Khwajah
Hasan soon formed acquaintance and friendship with the shopkeepers
around about him and treated all with profuse civilities,
but he was especially gracious and cordial to the son of Kasim,
a handsome youth and a well-dressed, and ofttimes he would
sit and chat with him for a long while. 
  
A few days after it chanced that Ali Baba, as he was sometime wont to do, came
to see his nephew, whom he found sitting in his shop.  
  
The Captain saw and recognised him at sight and one morning he asked
the young man, saying, "Prithee tell me, who is he that ever and
anon cometh to thee at thy place of sale?" whereto the youth made
answer, "He is my uncle, the brother of my father."  
  
Whereupon the Captain showed him yet greater favour and affection the better to
deceive him for his own devices, and gave him presents and made
him sit at meat with him and fed him with the daintiest of dishes.
  
Presently Ali Baba's nephew bethought him it was only right and
proper that he also should invite the merchant to supper, but
whereas his own house was small, and he was straitened for room
and could not make a show of splendour, as did Khwajah
Hasan, he took counsel with his uncle on the matter. 
  
Ali Baba replied to his nephew:
"Thou sayest well: it behoveth thee
to entreat thy friend in fairest fashion even as he hath entreated
thee. On the morrow, which is Friday, shut thy shop as do all merchants 
of repute; then, after the early meal, take Khwajah
Hasan to smell the air,and as thou walkest lead him hither
unawares; meanwhile I will give orders that Morgiana shall make
ready for his coming the best of viands and all necessaries for a
feast. Trouble not thyself on any wise, but leave the matter
in my hands."  
  
Accordingly on the next day, to wit, Friday,
the nephew of Ali Baba took Khwajah Hasan to walk about the
garden; and, as they were returning he led him by the street
wherein his uncle dwelt.  
  
When they came to the house, the
youth stopped at the door and knocking said,
"O my lord, this is my second home: my uncle hath heard much of thee and of
thy goodness mewards and desireth with exceeding desire to
see thee; so, shouldst thou consent to enter and visit him, I shall
be truly glad and thankful to thee."  
  
Albeit Khwajah Hasan
rejoiced in heart that he had thus found means whereby he might
have access to his enemy's house and household, and although he
hoped soon to attain his end by treachery, yet he hesitated to
enter in and stood to make his excuses and walk away. But
when the door was opened by the slave-porter, Ali Baba's nephew
seized his companion's hand and after abundant persuasion led
him in, whereat he entered with great show of cheerfulness as
though much pleased and honoured.  
  
The housemaster received
him with all favour and worship and asked him of his welfare, and
said to him, "O my lord, I am obliged and thankful to thee for
that thou hast shewn favour to the son of my brother and I perceive
that thou regardest him with an affection even fonder than my own."
  
Khwajah Hasan replied with pleasant words and said, "Thy
nephew vastly taketh my fancy and in him I am well pleased,
for that although young in years yet he hath been endued by Allah
with much of wisdom."  
  
Thus they twain conversed with friendly conversation and presently the guest rose to depart and said,
"O my lord, thy slave must now farewell thee; but on some future
day Inshallah he will again wait upon thee,"  
  
Ali Baba, however, would not let him leave and asked,
"Whither wendest thou, my friend ? I would invite thee to my table and I pray thee
sit at meat with us and after hie thee home in peace. Perchance
the dishes are not as delicate as those whereof thou art wont
to eat, still deign grant me this request I pray thee and refresh
thyself with my victual."  
  
Quoth Khwajah Hasan, "O my lord I am beholden to thee for thy gracious invitation, and with
pleasure would I sit at meat with thee, but for a special reason
must I needs excuse myself; suffer me therefore to depart for I
may not tarry longer nor accept thy gracious offer."  
  
Hereto the host made reply,
"I pray thee, O my lord, tell me what may be
the reason so urgent and weighty?" 
  
And Khwajah Hasan
answered, "The cause is this: I must not, by order of the physician,
who cured me lately of my complaint, eat aught of food prepared
with salt."  
  
Quoth Ali Baba,
"An this be all, deprive me not,
I pray thee, of the honour thy company will confer upon me: as
the meats are not yet cooked, I will forbid the kitchener to make
use of any salt. Tarry here awhile and I will return anon to
thee."  
  
So saying Ali Baba went in to Morgiana and bade her not
put salt into any one of the dishes; and she, while busied with
her cooking, fell to marvelling greatly at such order and asked
her master, "Who is he that eateth meat wherein is no salt?"
  
He answered, "What to thee mattereth it who he may be? Only
do thou my bidding."  
  
She rejoined, "'Tis well: all shall be as
thou wishest;" but in mind she wondered at the man who made
such strange request and desired much to look upon him.
  
Wherefore, when all the meats were ready for serving up, she
helped the slave-boy Abdullah to spread the table and set on
the meal; and no sooner did she see Khwajah Hasan than she
knew who he was, albeit he had disguised himself in the dress 
of a stranger merchant; furthermore, when she eyed him attentively
she espied a dagger hidden under his robe.  
  
"So ho!"
quoth she to herself, "this is the cause why the villain eateth
not of salt, for that he seeketh an opportunity to slay my master
whose mortal enemy he is; howbeit I will be beforehand with
him and despatch him ere he find a chance to harm my lord."  
  
Morgiana, having spread a white cloth upon the table and served
up the meal, went back to the kitchen and thought out her plot
against the robber-Captain.   
  
Now when Ali Baba and Khwajah
Hasan had eaten their sufficiency, the slave-boy Abdullah brought
Morgiana word to serve the dessert, and she cleared the table and
set on fruit fresh and dried in salvers, then she placed by the side
of Ali Baba a small tripod for three cups with a flagon of wine, and
lastly she went off with the slave-boy Abdullah into another room,
as though she would herself eat supper.   
  
Then Khwajah Hasan, that
is, the Captain of the robbers, perceiving that the coast was
clear, exulted mightily saying to himself,
"The time hath come for me to take full vengeance; 
with one thrust of my dagger I will
despatch this fellow, then escape across the garden and wend my
ways. His nephew will not adventure to stay my hand, for an he
do but move a finger or toe with that intent another stab will settle
his earthly account. Still must I wait awhile until the slave-boy
and the cook-maid shall have eaten and lain down to rest them in
the kitchen."   
  
Morgiana, however, watched him wistfully and divining his purpose said in her mind,
"I must not allow this villain advantage over my lord, but by some means I must make void his
project and at once put an end to the life of him."   
  
Accordingly, the trusty slave-girl changed her dress with all haste and donned
such clothes as dancers wear; she veiled her face with a costly
kerchief; around her head she bound a fine turband, and about her
middle she tied a waist-cloth worked with gold and silver wherein
she stuck a dagger, whose hilt was rich in filigree and jewelry.   
  
Thus disguised she said to the slave-boy Abdullah,
"Take now thy tambourine that we may play and sing and dance in honour of our
master's guest."   
  
So he did her bidding and the twain went into
the room, the lad playing and the lass following. Then, making a
low congee, they asked leave to perform and disport and play; and
Ali Baba gave permission, saying,
"Dance now and do your best
that this our guest may be mirthful and merry."   
  
Quoth Khwajah Hasan, "O my lord, thou dost indeed provide much pleasant entertainment."
  
Then the slave-boy Abdullah standing by began to strike
the tambourine whilst Morgiana rose up and showed her perfect
art and pleased them vastly with graceful steps and sportive motion;
and suddenly drawing the poniard from her belt she brandished
it and paced from side to side, a spectacle which pleased them
most of all. At times also she stood before them, now clapping
the sharp-edged dagger under her armpit and then setting it
against her breast. Lastly she took the tambourine from the
slave-boy Abdullah, and still holding the poniard in her right she
went round for largesse as is the custom amongst merry-makers.
  
First she stood before Ali Baba who threw a gold coin into the tambourine,
and his nephew likewise put in an Ashrafi; then Khwajah
Hasan, seeing her about to approach him, fell to pulling out his
purse, when she heartened her heart and quick as the blinding
leven she plunged the dagger into his vitals, and forthwith the
miscreant fell back stone-dead.   
  
Ali Baba was dismayed and cried in his wrath,
"O unhappy, what is this deed thou hast done to
bring about my ruin!"   
  
But she replied, "Nay, O my lord, rather to save thee and 
not to cause thee harm have I slain this
man: loosen his garments and see what thou wilt discover thereunder."   
  
So Ali Baba searched the dead man's dress and found
concealed therein a dagger.   
  
Then said Morgiana, "This wretch was thy deadly enemy. 
Consider him well: he is none other
than the oil merchant, the Captain of the band of robbers.
Whenas he came hither with intent to take thy life, he would not
eat thy salt; and when thou toldest me that he wished not any in
the meat I suspected him and at first sight I was assured that he
would surely do thee die; Almighty Allah be praised 'tis even as
I thought."   
  
Then Ali Babi lavished upon her thanks and expressions
of gratitude, saying, "Lo, these two times hast thou saved
me from his hand," and falling upon her neck he cried,
"See thou art free, and as reward for this thy fealty I have wedded thee to
my nephew."   
  
Then turning to the youth he said,
"Do as I bid thee and thou shalt prosper. I would that thou marry Morgiana, who
is a model of duty and loyalty: thou seest now yon Khwajah
Hasan sought thy friendship only that he might find opportunity
to take my life, but this maiden with her good sense and her
wisdom hath slain him and saved us."  
  
Ali Baba's nephew straightway consented to marry Morgiana. After
which the three, raising the dead body bore it forth with all heed
and vigilance and privily buried it in the garden, and for many
years no one knew aught thereof.   
  
In due time Ali Baba married his
brother's son to Morgiana with great pomp, and spread a bride-feast
in most sumptuous fashion for his friends and neighbours, and made
merry with them and enjoyed singing and all manner of dancing
and amusements. He prospered in every undertaking and Time
smiled upon him and a new source of wealth was opened to him. For
fear of the thieves he had not once visited the jungle-cave wherein 
lay the treasure, since the day he had carried forth the corpse of
his brother Kasim. But some time after, he mounted his hackney
one morning and journeyed thither, with all care and caution, till
finding no signs of man or horse, and reassured in his mind he
ventured to draw near the door.   
  
Then alighting from his beast he
tied it up to a tree, and going to the entrance pronounced the
words which he had not forgotten,
"Open, O Simsim!" 
  
Hereat, as was its wont, the door flew open, and entering thereby he saw
the goods and hoard of gold and silver untouched and lying as he
had left them. So he felt assured that not one of all the thieves
remained alive, and, that save himself there was not a soul who
knew the secret of the place. At once he bound in his saddlecloth
a load of Ashrafis such as his horse could bear and brought it
home; and in after days he showed the hoard to his sons and sons'
sons and taught them how the door could be caused to open and
shut.   
  
Thus Ali Baba and his household lived all their lives in wealth
and joyance in that city where erst he had been a pauper, and by
the blessing of that secret treasure he rose to high degree and
dignities.
