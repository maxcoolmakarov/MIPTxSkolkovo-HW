Nasreddin Hodja was standing in the marketplace when a stranger stepped 
up to him and slapped him in the face, but then said, "I beg your pardon. 
I thought that you were someone else."  
 This explanation did not satisfy the Hodja, so he brought the stranger 
before the qadi and demanded compensation.  
 The Hodja soon perceived that the qadi and the defendant were friends. 
The latter admitted his guilt, and the judge pronounced the sentence: "The 
settlement for this offense is one piaster, to be paid to the plaintiff. 
If you do not have a piaster with you, then you may bring it here to the 
plaintiff at your convenience."  
 Hearing this sentence, the defendant went on his way. The Hodja waited 
for him to return with the piaster. And he waited. And he waited.  
 Some time later the Hodja said to the qadi, "Do I understand correctly 
that one piaster is sufficient payment for a slap?"  
 "Yes," answered the qadi.  
 Hearing this answer, the Hodja slapped the judge in the face and said, 
"You may keep my  piaster when the defendant returns with it," then walked 
away.
