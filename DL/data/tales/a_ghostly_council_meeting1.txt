Late one night in a spinning room in Eppingen someone asked the question, who would dare to enter the old and reputedly haunted town hall.  
One girl volunteered to do this, and she took with her a switch and a black cat. Entering the council chamber she saw twelve ghostly councilmen seated around the table.  
They said to her, "If you hadn't brought the switch and the black cat with you, we would be saying something different to you!"  
The terrified girl fled, and she died that same night.
