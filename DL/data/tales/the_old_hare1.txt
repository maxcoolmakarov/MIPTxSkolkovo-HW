When I was a little girl, 'twas out near Loop Head I live. Well, there was
an old woman lived in a small little cabin by herself, and all the
neighbors around used to be in dread of her. They said she was chanted
[haunted]. No one knew how she lived, for she never left the cabin in the
day, but they said she used to go out through the fields at night. Nearly
every week some of the neigbors' milk would be gone, and if it wasn't, if
they were churning for a month, 'twouldn't make butter.
 
One, a man name of Shawn Teigue Mack, said he would know if 'twas she that
was taking the butter. So he watched all night at the cabin, and about
twelve o'clock he saw a hare come out of the house. The very minute it saw
Shawn, away would it across the field, but Shawn fired, and struck it in
the shoulder.
 
Begor, the next morning tracks of blood was seen along the road to the
cabin. What did Shawn do, but call to the cabin, and the door was barred
from inside. But he shoved in the window, and sure enough, there was the
old dame, and all her shoulder wrapped up in calico. She left the place
shortly after, for she knew she was found out, and no one ever missed
butter or milk after.
