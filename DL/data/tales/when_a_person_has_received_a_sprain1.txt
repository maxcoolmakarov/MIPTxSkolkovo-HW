When a person has received a sprain, it is customary to apply to an
individual
practiced in casting the "wresting thread."  This is a thread spun from
black
wool, on which are cast nine knots, and tied round a sprained leg or arm. 
During the time the operator is putting the thread round the affected
limb, he
says, but in such a tone of voice as not to be heard by the bystanders,
nor even
by the person operated upon:
 
The Lord rade,   
And the foal slade;   
He lighted.   
And he righted.   
Set joint to joint,   
Bone to bone,   
And sinew to sinew.   
Heal in the Holy Ghost's Name!
