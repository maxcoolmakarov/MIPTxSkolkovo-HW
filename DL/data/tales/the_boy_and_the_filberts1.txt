A boy put his hand into a jar of filberts and grasped as many as his 
fist could possibly hold. But when he tried to pull it out again, he found 
he couldn't do so, for the neck of the jar was too small to allow of the 
passage of so large a handful. Unwilling to lose his nuts but unable to 
withdraw his hand, he burst into tears.  
 A bystander, who saw where the trouble lay, said to him, "Come, my boy, 
don't be so greedy. Be content with half the amount, and you'll be able to 
get your hand out without difficulty."  
 Do not attempt too much at once.
