A woman in FÃ¼nfeichen was said to possess the sixth and seventh books of Moses. When asked how she would cure a mad dog, she replied that she would say: "Devil, depart from this animal. For that I give you body and soul!" But then she added: "This will restore the dog's health, but if it is a female dog, all of her pups will turn mad."
