A certain farmer, lying at the point of death, called his sons around him, 
and gave into their charge his fields and 

vineyards, telling them that a treasure lay hidden somewhere in them, 
within a foot of the surface of the ground. His 

sons thought he spoke of money which he had hidden, and after he was 
buried, they dug most industriously all over the 

estate, but found nothing. The soil being so well loosened, however, the 
succeeding crops were of unequalled richness, 

and the sons then found out what their father had in view in telling them 
to dig for hidden treasure.   
 Moral: Industry is fortune's right hand.
