A devastating plague laid waste to the village of Weggen, one hour distant from Luzern. One day the inhabitants of an old wooden house on the lake shore saw a small blue wisp of smoke. It hovered about and then floated into a crack in the wall. 
"That is the plague," said someone who saw it, then went and drove a wedge into the opening. 
From that hour onward the pestilence ceased in the village.  
Many years later a member of the family enlisted in foreign military duty. When the soldier returned home again his eye fell on the one spot on the wall, and he remembered its history. 
"Let's see," he said jokingly, "if the little wisp of smoke is still there." 
Although someone begged him not to do so, he quickly pulled out the plug, and the blue smoke jetted out.    
The plague, liberated again, struck down the brash soldier as its first victim. Soon afterward everyone in the house died, and many others in the village perished as well.
