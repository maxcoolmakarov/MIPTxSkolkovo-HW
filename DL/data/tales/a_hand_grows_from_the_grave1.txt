In the church at Lunow, three quarters of a mile from Oderberg, there is a
chopped off, dried up hand on display.  It is clenched into a fist and
holds a
switch between its fingers.  It comes from a son who in a godless manner
had
once struck his father.  God himself punished him, for when he died and
was
buried, his hand emerged from the grave. 
However often they reburied it, it always reappeared.  Finally they beat
it with
a switch, thinking that it would then return to beneath the earth, but
that did
not help.  Therefore they chopped off the hand, put the switch in its
fist, and
placed it in the church at Lunow as an eternal warning to godless
children.
