Some time ago a woman called Castle Lady and who was thought to be a witch 
lived in a small hut in Manternach. One night two cats came to the bedroom 
window of a man and howled pitifully. When the man got up and went outside 
the one cat ran away. The man grabbed the other one and beat it 
thoroughly, then threw it down the steps. Nevertheless it returned, and 
the man beat it until it stuck all four legs up; then he threw it over the 
wall into the garden.    
The next morning Castle Lady came to him and complained of pain throughout 
her entire body. The man said, "So, you old rascal, you are the one who 
made such a spectacle last night, the one I threw down the steps?"   
"Yes, I am the one," said the woman miserably.
