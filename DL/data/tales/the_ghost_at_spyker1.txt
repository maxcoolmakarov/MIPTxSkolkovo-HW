Uncanny things happen at Spyker, the ancient castle of the Wrangels.
The tower there is haunted. It is said that while they were building it,
every night it would collapse, until they entombed a human within its
walls. He now wanders about. 
 According to others there is a haunted chamber there where someone met
his death, and he is the one who wanders about.
