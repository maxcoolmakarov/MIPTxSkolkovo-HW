One time there was a man in this part of the country who used to go out every night to frighten another man. He would put a white sheet around him, and everyone was talking about the ghost. This was going for a long time and everyone was afraid to go by there, and one night he went as usual to frighten this man, and when the man came down he saw two ghosts tonight instead of one, and he said, "O God bless us there is two ghosts tonight instead of one," and at that the fellow with the sheet looked around he saw a real ghost standing beside him, and he got a great fright and he ran away home and never tried the trick again.  
This is the finish up of the story told by the old people, and it stopped the trick of playing ghosts at night in this part of the country.
