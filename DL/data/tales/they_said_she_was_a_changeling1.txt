About the year 1720, Søren married Jesper Bekhus's daughter Asloug. With her he got the farm, and they were quite well off.  However, Asloug was uglier than anyone, beyond measure ugly.   
It was said that she was a changeling, and there was reason to believe this legend. As a child her mother had whipped her and on many a Thursday night had left her out on the manure pile. The child had screamed and carried on like a wild dog, but she had not been re-exchanged. Finally they thought that they might as well keep her as she was.  
It was as the proverb states: "You cannot will beauty anymore than you can shit a lily."  
Nevertheless, Søren and Asloug lived quite well together and had many children, most of whom died as infants.
