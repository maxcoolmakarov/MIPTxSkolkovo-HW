In the old days, when men were allowed to have many wives, a middle-aged man had one wife that was old and one that was young; each loved him very much, and desired to see him like herself.  
Now the man's hair was turning
grey, which the young wife did not like, as it made him look too old for
her husband.  So every night she used to comb his hair and pull out the
white ones.  But the elder wife saw her husband growing grey with great
pleasure, for she did not like to be mistaken for his mother.  So every
morning she used to arrange his hair and pull out as many of the black
ones as she could.  In consequence the man soon found himself entirely
bald. 
   Yield to all and you will soon have nothing to yield.
