An old woman still living (1854) in Piersebridge, who mourned with
inordinate grief for a length of time the loss of a favorite daughter,
asserts that she was visited by the spirit of her departed child, and
earnestly exhorted not to disturb her peaceful repose by unnecessary
lamentations and repinings at the will of God; and from that time she
never grieved more. Events of this kind were common a century ago.
