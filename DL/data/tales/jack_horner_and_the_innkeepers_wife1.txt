An honest man an inkeeper,    
And friend to honest Jack,   
Who was alas, in debt so far,   
That he was like to crack.    
This man he had a handsome wife,   
Sweet fair and youthful too,   
A Quaker lov'd her as his life,   
An this Jack Horner knew.    
This Quaker was a 'Squire born,   
Who did in wealth abound,   
Thought Jack I'll catch him in the corn,   
Then put him in the pound.    
First to the inn-keeper I'll go,   
And whe I do him find,   
He soon shall understand and know,   
I will be truly kind:    
He met me in a narrow lane,   
And said, My Friend, good-morrow,   
The Inn-keeper replied again,   
My heart is full of sorrow,   
Two hundred pounds I am in debt,   
Which I should pay next week,   
It makes me sigh, lament and fret   
Having the coin to seek.    
Quoth Jack if you'll be rul'd by me,   
I'll put you in a way,   
How you yourself from debt may free,   
And all that money pay.    
Nay, this is joyful news, he cry'd   
Thou art a friend indeed,   
Thy wit whall be my rule and guide,   
For never was more need.    
Go tell thy loving wife said he,   
Thy joy and heart's delight,   
That thou must ride mildes forty three,   
And shan't be home to night.    
Then mind the council which I give,   
And be no ways afraid,   
For why I tell you as I live,   
Your debts shall soon be paid.     
Mount your bay nag and take your cloak   
With your warm morning-gown,   
And lodge within a hollow oak,   
A mile out of the town:   
There may you sleep in sweet content   
All night and take your rest,   
And leave it to my management,   
Then Sir, a pleasant jest,   
Next morning you shall there behold,   
The like ne'er seen before,   
Which shall produce a sum of Gold,    
Nay likewise silver store:    
The Inn-keeper said, Honest John   
Since you this promise make,   
Believe me, as I am a man,   
I will thy council take.    
Unto his Wife in haste he went   
And told her he must go   
A journey, saying be content,   
For why it must be so.    
She seemingly began to weep,   
And with sad sighs reply'd,   
You know alas! I cannot sleep   
Without you by my side.    
Said he kind Wife, do not repine,   
Why should You sigh and grieve?   
I go out to a friend jof mine,   
Some money to receive.    
This said, with woman's fond deceit,   
She straitway ceas'd to mourn,   
And gave him twenty kisses sweet,   
Wishing his safe return.    
So soon as he was out of sight,   
She to the Quaker sent,   
And order'd him to come at night,   
That to their heart's content   
They might be merry sport and play,   
Her husband being from home,   
The Quaker said, by Yea and Nay,   
I sill not fail to come.    
A sucking pib and capon too,   
For him she did prepare,   
For why alas, full well she knew   
He lov'd such dainty fare.    
Now just about the close of day,   
They both to supper fall;   
Now Jack was there as well as they   
And walk'd about the hall.    
He did her fond behaviour note,   
She on her friend did lean;   
Jack having his inchanted coat,   
He was not to be seen.   
He perfectly did hear and see   
How they did toy and play,   
Thought he I will revenged be   
Before the morning day.   
Her servant-maid she sent to bed   
When it grew somewhat late;   
This done, her Friend she likewise led   
Up to her chamber straight,   
Where he did soon strip off his cloaths,   
Stark-naked to his shirt,   
And into bed with her he goes,   
Concluding this not hurt.   
Jack in the chamber did abide    
'Till it was almost day,   
Where coming to the curtains' side,   
He heard the Quaker say,   
That he had now a need to piss,   
And to the pot must go,   
Thought Jack I do rejoice at this,   
A pleasant joke I'll show.    
The Quaker thinking little harm,   
Unto the pot he came,   
While Jack having a cunning charm,   
He locks him to the same.   
The good wife often to him cries,   
Whe sits thou in the cold,   
Quoth he, I sticks between my thighs,   
I cannot loose my hold.    
Quoth she, What is the man a fool,   
And strait to he she got   
Then laid one hand upon his tool,   
And t'other on the pot.    
There did she tug and pull amain,   
In hopes to set him free,   
Yet all their labour prov'd in vain,   
She stuck as fast as he.   
They being both in sad distress,   
Strait for the maid did knock,   
Who never stood herself to dress,   
But came up in her smock:    
The sight she saw was a surprize,   
So see such noble swingers,    
She clapt her hands before her eyes,   
Yet peep'd between her fingers.    
You saucy slut, then said her dame,   
Come help us from the pot,   
The damsel said, I blush for shame   
To see what he has got:    
What has he got you saucy sow,   
Whey do you stand to prate?   
Come hither soon and help us now,   
Or 'faith I'll break your pate.   
Because her mistress should be pleas'd   
She strove to set them free,   
But strait the charm the damsel seiz'd,   
And there they stuck all three.   
It being now just break of day,   
And they all linked fast,   
Jack on his Pipe began to play,   
And down the stairs he pass'd.   
The Quaker, Mistress, and her Maid,   
When they the Pipe did hear,   
All caper'd to the tune he play'd,   
And eke their course did steer   
Into the street, where they advanc'd   
Naked, save smock and shirt,   
Like morris-dancers did they prance   
Up to the knees in dirt:    
They caper'd high, the piss did fly,   
Over their heads and ears,   
And then did run violently   
Like drops of brinish tears.    
The Quaker said, by Yea and Nay,   
We are bewitch'd all three,   
I hear a pair of bag-pipes play,   
Yet no one can I see.    
He brought them to the very oak   
Where the Inn-keeper lay,   
Jack for a while he never spoke,   
But on his pipe did play.   
The good Man in the hollow tree,   
Immediately peep'd out,   
His Neighbour, Wife, and Maid he see   
All dance and jump about.   
Who's hear, my kind and loving wife,   
Likewise my maid young Sue,   
My Quaking neighbour too ads'life,   
A jovial whoring crew.    
Jack broke the Charm, and then the pot   
Soon loosen'd from their hands,   
And they were made quite reeking hot   
With skipping o'er the lands.   
The Inn-keeper said, Note it well,   
I'll geld you e'er you go;   
The Quaker on his knees he fell,   
And cried some pity show.    
My precious nutmegs do not wound,   
For fear I should not live,   
I'll pay you down one hundred pounds   
If you will me forgive.   
No no, quoth Jack we will have two,   
In lawful ready gold,   
Or else we will not pardon you,   
We have you fast in hold.    
I'll freely give they they demand,   
But yet take care I pray,   
The wicked does not understand,   
That I have walk'd astray.    
No, no, he dry'd, and home they went,    
Where they the gold receive;   
The Inn-keeper is well content,   
He has no cause to grieve.   
Then did he lead a happy life,   
He neither toils nor frets,   
Thanks to Jack Horner and his Wife,   
Their wits have paid the debts.
