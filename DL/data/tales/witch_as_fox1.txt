A number of hunters from Reutte went on a fox hunt in the "belt" between
Reutte and Heiterwang. They did not neglect to load something consecrated
into their weapons.
 After they had waited a long while, a fox finally came into view, and
they fired a heavy volley at it. The fox tumbled down, but then it got
back on its feet and fled. The hunters followed its tracks, which were
clearly visible in the snow.
 After they had followed the tracks for a good stretch, it suddenly
occurred to them that the footprints left by the fox in the snow were
getting larger and larger, finally taking the form of human footprints.
They could even clearly see that the tracks could have been made only by
slippers.
 They could only imagine what all this had to do with the fox that they
had shot at, but they continued to follow the tracks, which led them
finally to a house in the upper marketplace in Reutte. An old woman lived
in this house, and she was lying in bed with a bullet wound in her body.
