Once upon a time there was a priest who had a son who was so good that everyone loved him. His task was to go out and tend the goats. One day he met Pan at his pasture, and Pan gave him a kid like no other in the world: its fur was golden, its ears were silver and his hooves were platinum. The youth had scarcely received the kid when he offered it to God as a burnt sacrifice.  
Then an angel, sent from God, appeared before him and asked him what reward he wanted for this act. The youth replied that he wished only for a shepherd's pipe with the quality that whenever he played it all who heard it would begin to dance. Such a flute was suddenly there.  
The youth took it, and whenever he was threatened, he saved himself with his flute. Then came the order from the king to have him arrested, but no one was able to capture him.  
Finally, in order to take revenge on the king, he voluntarily allowed himself to be captured. After they had thrown him into prison, he began to blow his flute, and not only animals and people danced, but also houses and cliffs. The houses and cliffs fell on the people and crushed them all together with the king. Only the youth himself and his family survived.  
The whole thing was instigated by Pan to cleanse the world of bad people.
