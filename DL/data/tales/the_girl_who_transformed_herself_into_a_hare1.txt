In Trent there formerly lived a girl who had inherited a witch's thong
from her grandmother. Whenever she tied the thong around herself she would
turn into a hare. In this form she often heckled a forester who lived in
the vicinity. Whenever he would shoot at her, his bullets just glanced off
her pelt. When he came to realize that there was something uncanny going
on here, he loaded his flintlock with a coffin nail that he had somehow
acquired.
 The next time he saw the hare, he shot it as it was running away. In an
instant the hare disappeared, and the girl stood before him in its place.
With tears she asked him for help, for she had a serious wound on her
foot. In order to gain his sympathy, she confessed her evil power to the
forester, promising never again to make use of it.
 For a time she kept her promise, but no sooner had her foot healed than
she fell back into her old vices. Now her fiancé worked as a
herdsman at a nearby estate, and she frequently made use of her thong in
order to visit him often and undisturbed. Her fiancé knew nothing
of her powers, and one day when she appeared before him as a hare -- for
she had not yet had time to assume her human form -- he struck her with a
water carrier. As a result she started to bleed profusely, and with tears
she confessed to her fiancé what her situation was.
 He broke off his relationship with her. She remained lame for the rest
of her life. It is said that the witch's thong was later buried in the
grandmother's grave.
