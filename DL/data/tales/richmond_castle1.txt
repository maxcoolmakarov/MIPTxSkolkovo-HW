On the south side of the river [Swale, near Richmond], is the remarkable circular hill called the Round Howe, near a large natural cave called Arthur's Oven.   
And hereupon comes to mind a Richmond legend, parallel with various other stories told of King Arthur in the north. A person walking round Richmond castle, was arrested by a "man," who took him into a strange vault beneath the fortress, where a multitude of people were lying on the ground, as if in a deep slumber. In this chamber a horn and a sword were presented to him, for the usual purpose of releasing the sleepers of other days from their long listnessness. But when he drew the sword half out of its sheath, a stir among them all terrified him to such a degree, that he let the blade fall back to its place and an indignant voice instantly cried: 
 
Potter, Potter Thompson!  
If thou had either drawn  
The sword or blown that horn,  
Thou'd been the luckiest man  
That ever [yet] was born. 
 
The tradition adds, that no opportunity of breaking the enchantment will again be afforded before a definite time has elapsed.
