One fine day in winter some ants were busy drying their store of corn, which had got rather damp during a long spell of rain. Presently up came a grasshopper and begged them to spare her a few grains, "For," she said, "I'm simply starving."  
The ants stopped work for a moment, though this was against their principles. "May we ask," said they, "what you were doing with yourself all last summer? Why didn't you collect a store of food for the winter?"  
"The fact is," replied the grasshopper, "I was so busy singing that I hadn't the time."  
"If you spent the summer singing," replied the ants, "you can't do better than spend the winter dancing."  
And they chuckled and went on with their work.
