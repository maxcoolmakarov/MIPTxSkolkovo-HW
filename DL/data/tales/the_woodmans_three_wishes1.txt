A woodman went to the forest to fell some timber. Just as he was applying 
the axe to the trunk of a huge old oak, out jumped a fairy, who beseeched 
him with the most supplicating gestures to spare the tree. Moved more by 
fright and astonishment than anything else, the man consented, and as a 
reward for his forbearance was promised the fulfillment of his three next 
wishes.   
Whether from natural forgetfulness, or fairy illusion, we know not, but 
certain it is, that long before evening all remembrance of his visitor had 
passed from his noddle. At night, when he and his dame were dozing before 
a blazing fire, the old fellow waxed hungry, and audibly wished for a link 
of hog's pudding.   
No sooner had the words escaped his lips than a rustling was heard in the 
chimney, and down came a bunch of the wished-for delicacies, depositing 
themselves at the feet of the astounded woodman, who, thus reminded of his 
morning visitor, began to communicate the particulars to his wife.   
"Thou bist a fool, Jan," said she, incensed at her husband's carelessness 
in neglecting to make the best of his good luck. " I wish em wer atte 
no√§se!" whereupon, the legend goes on to state, they immediately 
attached themselves to the member in question, and stuck so tight that the 
woodman, finding no amount of force would remove these unsightly 
appendages from his proboscis, was obliged, reluctantly, to wish them off, 
thus making the third wish, and at once ending his brilliant expectations.
