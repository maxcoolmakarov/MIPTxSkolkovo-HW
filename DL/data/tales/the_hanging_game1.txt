Some years ago, when driving past a gallows standing in a field at
Melton Ross, an old man told me a curious tale. He said, "Some hundred of
years ago, three or four boys were playing at hanging, and seeing who
could hang the longest in a tree. Just as one of them got up and put the
noose on, a three-legged hare (the devil, sir) came limping past, and off
the other lads ran after him, and forgot their comrade. They very nearly
caught the hare several times, but he got away. And when they came back
the lad in the tree was dead. That's what the gallows was put up for."
