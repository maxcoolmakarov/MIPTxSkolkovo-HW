The Hodja purchased a piece of meat at the market, and on his way home 
he met a friend.  
 Seeing the Hodja's purchase, the friend told him an excellent recipe 
for stew.  
 "I'll forget it for sure," said the Hodja. "Write it on a piece of 
paper for me."  
 The friend obliged him, and the Hodja continued on his way, the piece 
of meat in one hand and the recipe in the other. He had not walked far 
when suddenly a large hawk swooped down from the sky, snatched the meat, 
and flew away with it.  
 "It will do you no good!" shouted the Hodja after the disappearing 
hawk. "I still have the recipe!"
