Folk Legends from Altmark 
 
  To prevent the "thickheads" (underground spirits) from exchanging a
newborn child, it must be continuously watched until it is baptized.  For
this reason the baptism takes place as soon as possible. 
  Dwarfs in the region between Salzwedel and Disdorf are not called
"thickheads," but rather "the underground people."  Here the belief that a
child can be exchanged is especially strong.  People fear that the
misshapen dwarfs who live beneath the earth, and who would like nothing
more than to have beautiful, well-formed human children, will steal
newborns, leaving their own malformed children, called changelings, in
their place.  Therefore there is always a great rush to have the child
baptized, and until this happens the mother and child will not be left
alone for even an instant.  Furthermore, until then there must always be a
burning light near them, even in broad daylight, because the underground
people are afraid of light. 
  A child must carefully and continuously be protected against exchange
by the underground people until it is baptized.  Therefore the so-called
"word of God," a leaf from the Bible from a hymnbook, is either wrapped up
with the child in its blanket or laid in its cradle.
