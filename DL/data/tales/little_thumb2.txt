Once there was a couple who had many children. One of them was a little boy who was no taller than a thumb. He was called Little Thumb.  
One day his mother said to him, "I am going to the meadow. You will stay here and take care of house.  
"Mom," he said, "I want to go with you."  
"No, our Thumb, you must stay here."  
Little Thumb pretended to obey; but, when his mother left, he followed her without her noticing. When he reached the meadow, he hid himself in the first armful of grass that his mother had cut. She unwittingly put him in her basket. The grass was given to the cow, and thus Little Thumb was swallowed.  
That evening, the mother wanted to milk the cow. "Turn around, Blackie."  
"No, I'll not turn around." The astonished woman ran to fetch her husband.  
"Turn around, Blackie." 
"No, I'll not turn around."  
Tired of this battle, they called the butcher, who said that the beast should be slaughtered. Thus the cow was therefore killed and butchered. The stomach was thrown into the street, where an old woman picked it up and put it in her basket. On leaving the village she had too much to carry and had to stop halfway up a hill. She left the cow's stomach on the road.  
A hungry wolf came by and swallowed the stomach together with Little Thumb. The wolf continued to prowl and came to a flock of sheep.  
Little Thumb cried out, "Shepherd, look out for your flock! Shepherd, look out for your flock!"  
This frightened the wolf ---- and Little Thumb suddenly found himself on the ground. He cleaned himself as best he could and went back to his parents.  
His mother said to him, "There you are, our Thumb!" I thought that you were lost." 
"I was in the grass, but you didn't see me."  
"No, I didn't. I really thought that you were lost."  
"Well, mom! I'm here now."
