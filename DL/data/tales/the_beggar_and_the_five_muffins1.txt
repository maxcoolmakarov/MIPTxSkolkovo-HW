In a certain village there lived a poor beggar and his wife. The man
used to go out every morning with a clean vessel in his hand, return home
with rice enough for the day's meal, and thus they lived on in extreme
poverty. 
 One day a poor Mádhava Brahmin invited the pair to a feast, and
among Mádhavas muffins ( tôsai ) are always a part of
the good things on festive occasions. So during the feast the beggar and
his wife had their fill of muffins. They were so pleased with them, that
the woman was extremely anxious to prepare some muffins in her own house,
and began to save a little rice every day from what her husband brought
her for the purpose.  
 When  enough had been thus collected she begged a poor neighbor's wife
to give her a little black pulse, which the latter -- praised be her
charity -- readily did. The faces of the beggar and his wife literally
glowed with joy that day, for were they not to taste the long-desired
muffins for a second time? 
 The woman soon turned the rice she had been saving, and the black pulse
she had obtained form her neighbor into a paste, and mixing it well with a
little salt, green chilies, coriander seed, and curds, set it in a pan on
the fire. And with her mouth watering all the while, prepared five
muffins. By the time her husband had returned from his collection of alms,
she was just turning out of the pan the fifth muffin. And when she placed
the whole five muffins before him, his mouth, too, began to water.  
 He kept two for himself and two he place before his wife. But what was
to be done with the fifth? He did not understand the way out of this
difficulty. That half and half made one, and that each could take two and
a half muffins was a question too hard for him to solve. The beloved
muffins must not be torn in pieces. So he said to his wife that either he
or she must take the remaining one. But how were they to decide which
should be the lucky one? 
 Proposed the husband, "Let us both shut our eyes and stretch ourselves
as if in sleep, each on a verandah on either side of the kitchen. Whoever
opens an eye and speaks first gets only two muffins, and the other gets
three." 
 So great was the desire of each to get the three muffins, that they
both abided by the agreement, and the woman, though her mouth watered for
the muffins, resolved to go through the ordeal. She placed the five cakes
in a pan and covered it over with another pan. She then carefully bolted
the door inside, and asking her husband to go into the east verandah, she
lay down in the west one. Sleep she had none, and with closed eyes kept
guard over her husband, for if he spoke first, he would have only two
muffins, and the other three would come to her share. Equally watchful was
her husband over her. 
 Thus passed one whole day -- two -- three! The house was never opened.
No beggar came to receive the morning dole. The whole village began to
inquire after the missing beggar. What had become of him? What had become
of his wife? 
 "See whether his house is locked on the outside and whether he has left
us to go to some other village," spoke the gray-heads. 
 So the village watchman came and tried to push the door open, but it
would not open. 
 "Surely," said they, "it is locked on the inside! Some great calamity
must have happened. Perhaps thieves have entered the house, and after
plundering their property, murdered the inmates." 
 "But what property is a beggar likely to have?" thought the village
assembly, and not liking to waste time in idle speculations, they sent two
watchmen to climb the roof and open the latch from the inside. 
 Meanwhile the whole village -- men, women, and children -- stood
outside the beggar's house to see what had taken place inside. The
watchmen jumped into the house, and to their horror found the beggar and
his wife stretched on opposite verandahs like two corpses. They opened the
door, and the whole village rushed in. They too saw the beggar and his
wife lying so still that they thought them to be dead. And though the
beggar pair had heard everything that passed around them, neither would
open an eye or speak, for whoever did it first would get only two
muffins! 
 At the public expense of the village, two green litters of bamboo and
coconut leaves were prepared on which to remove the unfortunate pair to
the cremation ground. 
 "How loving they must have been to have died together like this!" said
some gray-beards of the village. 
 In time the cremation ground was reached, and village watchmen had
collected a score of dried cow-dung cakes and a bundle of firewood from
each house for the funeral pyre. From these charitable contributions two
pyres had been prepared, one for the man and one for the woman. The pyre
was then lighted, and when the fire approached his leg, the man thought it
time to give up the ordeal and to be satisfied with only two muffins. 
 So while the villagers were still continuing the funeral rites, they
suddenly heard a voice, "I shall be satisfied with two muffins!" 
 Immediately another voice replied from the woman's pyre, "I have gained
the day. Let me have the three!" 
 The villagers were amazed and ran away. One bold man alone stood face
to face with the supposed dead husband and wife. He was a bold man,
indeed, for when a dead man or a man supposed to have died comes to life,
village people consider him to be a ghost. However, this bold villager
questioned the beggars until he came to know their story. He then went
after the runaways and related to them the whole story of the five
muffins, to their great amazement. 
 But what was to be done to the people who had thus voluntarily faced
death out of love for muffins? 
 Persons who had ascended the green litter and slept on the funeral pyre
could never come back to the village! If they did the whole village would
perish. So the elders built a small hut in a deserted meadow outside the
village and made the beggar and his wife live there. 
 Ever after that memorable day, our hero and his wife were called the
muffin beggar and the muffin beggar's wife, and many old ladies and young
children from the village used to bring them muffins in the morning and
evening, out of pity for them, for had they not loved muffins so much that
they underwent death in life?
