A crow was sitting on a branch of a tree with a piece of cheese in her 
beak when a fox observed her and set his wits to work to discover some way 
of getting the cheese.  Coming and standing under the tree he looked up 
and said, "What a noble bird I see above me!  Her beauty is without equal, 
the hue of her plumage exquisite.  If only her voice is as sweet as her 
looks are fair, she ought without doubt to be queen of the birds."  The 
crow was hugely flattered by this, and just to show the fox that she could 
sing she gave a loud caw.  Down came the cheese, of course, and the fox, 
snatching it up, said, "You have a voice, madam, I see.  What you want is 
wits."
