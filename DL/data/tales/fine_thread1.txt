A man ordered some fine thread from a spinner. The spinner spun it for him, but the man said that the thread was not good, and that he wanted the finest thread he could get.  
The spinner said: "If this is not fine enough, take this!" and she pointed to an empty space.  
He said that he did not see any.  
The spinner said: "You do not see it, because it is so fine. I do not see it myself."  
The fool was glad, and ordered some more thread of this kind, and paid her for what he got.
