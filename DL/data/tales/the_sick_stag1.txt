A stag, whose joints had become stiff with old age, was at great pains to 
get together a large heap of fodder -- 

enough, as he thought, to last him for the remainder of his days. He 
stretched himself out upon it, and, now dozing, 

now nibbling, made up his mind to wait quietly for the end.    
He had always been of a gay and lively turn, and had made in his time many 
friends. These now came in great numbers to 

see him and wish him farewell. While engaged in friendly talk over past 
adventures and old times, what more natural 

than that they should help themselves to a little of the food which seemed 
so plentifully stored around? The end of 

the matter was, that the poor stag died not so much of sickness or of old 
age as for sheer want of the food which his 

friends had eaten for him.  
 Moral: Thoughtless friends bring more hurt than profit.
