The alp, or as it is most often called, the "m채rt," is frequently 
encountered in Pomerania. A m채rt rides on sleeping people at night, 
pressing against them until at last they can no longer breathe. A 
m채rt is usually a girl who has a bad foot. Once in the village of 
Bork near Stargard there was a smith who had a daughter with a bad foot, 
and at that time an unusually large number of people complained that they 
were being ridden by a m채rt.
