It was now  Cuckow-Time  and a Certain  Middle-Ag'd Man , that was Half-Gray, Half-Brown, took a fancy to Marry Two Wives, of an Age One under Another, and Happy was the Woman that could please him Best. They took Mighty Care of him to All manner of Purposes, and still as they were Combing the Good Man's Head, they'd be Picking out here and there a Hair to make it all of a Colour. The Matronly Wife, she Pluck'd out All the  Brown  Hairs, and the Younger the  White : So that they left the Man in in Conclusion no better than a  Bald Buzzard  betwixt them.  
 The Moral   
 'Tis a much Harder Thing to Please Two Wives then Two Masters; and He's a Bold Man that offers at it.
