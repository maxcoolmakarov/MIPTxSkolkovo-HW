Adam and Eve were standing on the bank of a brook, and before them lay
the corpse of Abel, who had been killed by Cain. As they sat there, not
knowing what they should do with the corpse, suddenly a little bird fell
from a nearby tree. The little bird was still very young and could not
fly. The fall killed it. Adam and Eve looked at the dead bird and saw that
it was a raven. Soon the old raven flew by, and when he saw that his young
one was dead, he scratched a hole in the ground with his feet, and laid it
inside. Then he scratched the hole full and flew away. Adam and Eve
observed all this and followed the raven's example. They made a hole in
the earth, laid Abel's corpse in it, and covered it with earth. This was
the first human grave.
