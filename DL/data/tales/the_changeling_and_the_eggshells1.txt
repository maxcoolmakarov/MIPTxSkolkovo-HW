A woman's child was once changed by the troll-folk, and instead of a beautiful fair-haired child, she got a little dumpy creature, with a big head, and little eyes as black as coal.  
The poor mother had recourse to a "wise woman," who gave her the following advice. She should first try whether the child was really a changeling, and if was so, she should threaten to throw it into the heated baking-oven, and then its real mother would come and take it away.  
The woman therefore set the changeling down on the hearth, while she went about saying to herself that now she would start to brew. She then took seven eggshells filled with water, and set them on the fire beside the child, after which she hid herself near at hand, to see how the changeling would behave at this.  
It looked long at the eggshells in which the water was boiling, and then exclaimed in amazement: "Long have I lived and much have I seen. I have seen Rold Forest seven times burned down, and seven times grow up again, but never have I seen anyone brew in eggshells."  
The woman then came out of her hiding-place and said: "Then you are old enough now, you little troll! Into the oven you shall go."  
But immediately there appeared a little grey female with the woman's child on her arm, which she gave her, while at the same time she seized the changeling and said, "I have never treated your child as you have treated mine!"
