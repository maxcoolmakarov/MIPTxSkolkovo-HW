In a certain place there lived a Brahman by the name of 
Svabh√¢vakripana, which means "luckless by his very nature." By 
begging he acquired a quantity of rice gruel, and after he had eaten what 
he wanted, there was still a potful left. He hung this pot on a nail in 
the wall above his bed. As night progressed, he could not take his eyes 
from the pot. All the while he was thinking:  
 This pot is filled to overflowing with rice gruel. If a famine 
should come to the land, then I could sell it for a hundred pieces of 
silver. Then I could buy a pair of goats. They have kids every six months, 
so I would soon have an entire herd of goats. Then I would trade the goats 
for cattle. As soon as the cows had calved, I would sell the calves. Then 
I would trade the cattle for buffalo. And the buffalo for horses. And when 
the horses foaled, I would own many horses. From their sale I would gain a 
large amount of gold. With this gold I would buy a house with four 
buildings in a rectangle.  
 Then a Brahman would enter my house and give me a very 
beautiful girl with a large dowry for my wife. She will give birth to a 
son, and I will give him the name Somasarman. When he is old enough to be 
bounced on my knee, I will take a book, sit in the horse stall, and read. 
In the meantime, Somasarman will see me and want to be bounced on my knee. 
He will climb down from his mother's lap and walk toward me, coming close 
to the horses hooves. Then, filled with anger, I will shout at my wife, 
"Take the child! Take the child!"  
 But she, busy with her housework, will not hear me. So I will 
jump up and give her a kick!  
 And, buried in his thoughts, he struck out with his foot, breaking the 
pot, and painting himself white with the rice gruel that had been in it. 
Therefore I say:  
 He who dreams about unrealistic projects for the future will 
have the same fate as Somasarman's father: He will find himself lying 
there painted white with rice gruel.
