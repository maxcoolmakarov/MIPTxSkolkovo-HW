A woman did not get married until she was fifty years old, because she did
not want to have any children, but she did not avoid her fate.  Soon after
marrying, she had twelve children all at once, the number she would have
had if she had married at the right time.  The twelve tiny babies all
appeared to be dead, but someone laid them in a warm oven, and one of them
came to life.  It is said that he grew up to be a fine man.
