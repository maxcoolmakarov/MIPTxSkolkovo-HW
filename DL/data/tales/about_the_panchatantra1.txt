One of India's most influential contributions to world literature, the 
 Panchatantra  (also spelled  Pañcatantra  or 
 Pañca-tantra ) consists of five books of animal fables and 
magic tales (some 87 stories in all) that were compiled, in their current 
form, between the third and fifth centuries AD. The German Sanskrit scholar Johannes Hertel (1872-1955) believed that the original collection was compiled in Kashmir about 200 BC, and that at this time many of the stories were already ancient. The work's self-proclaimed purpose is to educate the sons of royalty.  
 Although the original author's or compiler's name is unknown, an Arabic 
translation from about 750 AD attributes the Panchatantra to a wise man 
called Bidpai, which is probably a Sanskrit word meaning "court scholar." 
 
 The fables of the  Panchatantra  found their way to Europe through 
oral folklore channels and by way of Persian and Arabic translations. They 
substantially influenced medieval writers of fables.
