In a mill a rat once lived and prospered. It took after the miller, and 
from day to day its paunch grew bigger. It became as 

round as a cucumber and as fat as a candle.   
 One day, looking at its round, sleek figure, the rat said to itself, 
"Behold I am so beautiful and strong. Why should I not go 

and pay a visit to God? He is sure to receive me."   
 No sooner said than done. Leaving the mill, he started on his journey 
to God. After traveling a few days and not coming 

nearer to God, he stopped and said, "Methinks that either God lives much 
farther away than I believed, or I have lost my way. I 

will go to the sun and ask where God is."   
 Coming to the sun, the rat asked, "Where is God?"   
 "Off with you," shouted the sun. "I have no time for idle talkers."  
 
 The rat went to the clouds and asked them, "Where is God?"   
 "We cannot stop to bandy words with the like of you."   
 Away the rat went and came to the wind. "Where is God?" asked the rat.  
 
 "There," replied the wind, whistling, and getting hold of the rat 
hurled him down onto an ant-heap, and there he found his 

level.
