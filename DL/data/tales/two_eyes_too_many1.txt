In Hiddestorf, not too long ago, there
lived a widow who every Sunday was miraculously able to cook the most
delicious meals.  By the time that the servant girls had gone to church in
the morning, she had not yet made a fire, had not cleaned the vegetables,
and had not even fetched any meat.  But by the time church was finished,
the best meal was on the table. 
Because that was not possible with ordinary powers, one Sunday a servant
hid himself behind a large barrel in the kitchen in order to spy on the
woman. 
Just about the time the sermon was beginning there was a commotion in the
chimney, and the devil came down and began to caress the woman.  Afterward
he started to fill the pots for her, but he suddenly stood still and said,
"Woman, there are two eyes too many in here!"  She denied it.  "There are
two eyes too many in here!" he said again, but when the woman began to
make fun of him, he filled the pots and disappeared up the chimney. 
At noon when everyone was seated at the table, the servant said, "I don't
want to eat, because I know that it came from the devil!" 
He had scarcely spoken when the Black One came in through the window,
grabbed the woman by her braid, wrung her neck, and flew out the window
with her.
