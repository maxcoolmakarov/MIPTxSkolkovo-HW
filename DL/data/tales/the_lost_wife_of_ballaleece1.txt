One time the Farmer of Ballaleece married 
a beautiful young wife, and they were 
thinking the world of one another. But 
before long she disappeared. Some persons 
said that she was dead and others 
that she was taken by the Little People. 
Ballaleece mourned for her with a heavy 
heart and looked for her from Point of Ayr 
to the Calf; but in the end, not finding her, 
he married another wife. This one was not 
beautiful, but there was some money at 
her. 
 
Soon after the marriage his first wife 
appeared to Ballaleece one night, and said 
to him, "My man, my man, I was taken away 
by the Little People, and I live with them 
near to you. I can be set free if you will 
but do what I tell you." 
 
"Tell me quick," said Ballaleece. 
 
"We'll be riding through Ballaleece 
barn at midnight on Friday," said she. 
"We'll be going in on one door and out 
on another. I'll be riding behind one of 
the men on horseback. You'll sweep the 
barn clean, and mind there is not one straw 
left on the floor. Catch hold of my bridle 
rein, hold it fast, and I shall be free." 
 
When the night came Ballaleece took 
a besom and swept the barn floor so clean 
that not one speck was left on it. Then he 
waited in the dark. 
 
At midnight the barn doors opened wide, 
sweet music was heard, and in through the 
open door came a fine company of Little 
People, in green jackets and red caps, 
riding fine horses. On the last horse, 
sitting behind a Little Fellow, Ballaleece 
saw his first wife as pretty as a picture, and 
as young as when she left him. He seized 
hold of her bridle rein, but he was shaken 
from side to side like a leaf on a tree, and 
he was not able to hold her. 
 
As she went out through the door she stretched out her 
right hand and pointed to a bushel in the 
corner of the barn, and called out in a sad 
voice, "There's been a straw put under the 
bushel for that reason you couldn't hold 
me, and you've done with me for ever!" 
 
The second wife had heard what had 
passed and had hidden the straw, and 
turned the bushel upside down so that it 
would not be seen. 
 
The young wife was never heard of any 
more.
