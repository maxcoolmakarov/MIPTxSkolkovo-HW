The Fairy Faith in Celtic Countries  
A woman who lived near Breage Church [Isle of Man] had a fine girl baby, 
and she thought the piskies came and took it and put a withered child in 
its place.  The withered child lived to be twenty years old, and was no 
larger when it died than when the piskies brought it.  It was fretful and 
peevish and frightfully shriveled.  The parents believed that the piskies 
often used to come and look over a certain wall by the house to see the 
child.  And I heard my grandmother say that the family once put the child 
out of doors at night to see if the piskies would take it back again.
