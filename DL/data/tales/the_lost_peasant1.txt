Ten peasants were standing on the side of the road weeping. They 
thought that one of their number had been lost on the way, as each man had 
counted the company and found them nine only.  
 "Ho, you! What is the matter?" asked a townsman passing by.  
 "Oh, sir," said the peasants, "we were ten men when we left the 
village, but now we are only nine."  
 The townsman saw at a glance what fools they were. Each of them had 
omitted to count himself in the number. He therefore told them to take off 
their  top√≠s  [skull caps] and place them on the ground. This 
they did, and counted ten of them, whereupon they supposed they were all 
there, and were comforted. But they could not tell how it was.
