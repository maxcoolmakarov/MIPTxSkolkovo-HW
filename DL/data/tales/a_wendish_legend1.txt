During heathen times the Sorbian Wends of Lausitz practiced the shameful
and gruesome custom of ridding themselves of their old people who were no
longer able to contribute.  A son would strike his own father dead when he
became old and incompetent, or he would throw him into water, or he would
push him over a high cliff.  Indeed, there are many examples of this, even
after the advent of Christianity.
 
For example:  Herr Levin von Schulenburg, a high official in Altmark, was
traveling among the Wends in about 1580 when he saw an old man being led
away by several people.  "Where are you going with the old man?" he asked,
and received the answer, "To God!"
 
They were going to sacrifice him to God, because he was no longer able to
earn his own sustenance.  When the official grasped what was happening, he
forced them to turn the old man over to him.  He took him home with him
and hired him as a gatekeeper, a position that he held for twenty
additional years.
