Once upon a time, and be sure 'twas a long time ago, there lived a poor 
woodman in a great forest, and every day of his life he went out to fell 
timber. So one day he started out, and the goodwife filled his wallet and 
slung his bottle on his back, that he might have meat and drink in the 
forest. He had marked out a huge old oak, which, thought he, would furnish 
many and many a good plank. And when he was come to it, he took his ax in 
his hand and swung it round his head as though he were minded to fell the 
tree at one stroke. But he hadn't given one blow, when what should he hear 
but the pitifullest entreating, and there stood before him a fairy who 
prayed and beseeched him to spare the tree. He was dazed, as you may 
fancy, with wonderment and affright, and he couldn't open his mouth to 
utter a word. But he found his tongue at last, and, "Well," said he, "I'll 
e'en do as thou wishest."  
 "You've done better for yourself than you know," answered the fairy, 
"and to show I'm not ungrateful, I'll grant you your next three wishes, be 
they what they may." And therewith the fairy was no more to be seen, and 
the woodman slung his wallet over his shoulder and his bottle at his side, 
and off he started home.  
 But the way was long, and the poor man was regularly dazed with the 
wonderful thing that had befallen him, and when he got home there was 
nothing in his noddle but the wish to sit down and rest. Maybe, too, 'twas 
a trick of the fairy's. Who can tell? Anyhow, down he sat by the blazing 
fire, and as he sat he waxed hungry, though it was a long way off 
suppertime yet.  
 "Hasn't thou naught for supper, dame?" said he to his wife.  
 "Nay, not for a couple of hours yet," said she.  
 "Ah!" groaned the woodman, "I wish I'd a good link of black pudding 
here before me."  
 No sooner had he said the word, when clatter, clatter, rustle, rustle, 
what should come down the chimney but a link of the finest black pudding 
the heart of man could wish for.  
 If the woodman stared, the goodwife stared three times as much. "What's 
all this?" says she.  
 Then all the morning's work came back to the woodman, and he told his 
tale right out, from beginning to end, and as he told it the goodwife 
glowered and glowered, and when he had made an end of it she burst out, 
"Thou bee'st but a fool, Jan, thou bee'st but a fool; and I wish the 
pudding were at thy nose, I do indeed."  
 And before you could say "Jack Robinson," there the goodman sat, and 
his nose was the longer for a noble link of black pudding.  
 He gave a pull, but it stuck, and she gave a pull, but it stuck, and 
they both pulled till they had nigh pulled the nose off, but it stuck and 
stuck.  
 "What's to be done now?" said he.  
 "'Tisn't so very unsightly," said she, looking hard at him.  
 Then the woodman saw that if he wished, he must need wish in a hurry; 
and wish he did, that the black pudding might come off his nose. Well! 
there it lay in a dish on the table, and if the goodman and goodwife 
didn't ride in a golden coach, or dress in silk and satin, why, they had 
at least as fine a black pudding for their supper as the heart of man 
could desire.
