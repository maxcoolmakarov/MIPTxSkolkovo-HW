Nasreddin Hodja and a friend were discussing their wives, when it 
occurred to the friend that Nasreddin had never mentioned his wife's name. 
 
 "What is your wife's name?" he asked.  
 "I do not know her name," admitted the Hodja.  
 "What?" asked the friend in disbelief. "How long have you been 
married?"  
 "Twenty years," answered the Hodja, then added, "At first I did not 
think that the marriage would last, so I did not take the effort to learn 
my bride's name."
