A cunning old rat discovered in his rounds a most tempting piece of 
cheese, which was placed in a trap. But being well 

aware that if he touched it he would be caught, he slyly sought one of his 
young friends, and, under the mask of 

friendship, informed him of the prize. "I cannot use it myself," said he, 
"for I have just made a hearty meal."    
The inexperienced youngster thanked him with gratitude for the news, and 
heedlessly sprang upon the tempting bait; on 

which the trap closed and instantly destroyed him. his companion, being 
now quite secure, quietly ate up the cheese.  
 Moral: Do not listen to every passer-by.
