Part of the canon of sacred Buddhist literature, this collection of 
some 550 anecdotes and fables depicts earlier incarnations -- sometimes as 
an animal, sometimes as a human -- of the being who would become 
Siddhartha Gautama, the future Buddha. Traditional birth and death dates 
of Gautama are 563-483 BC. The Jataka tales are dated between 300 BC and 
400 AD.  
 Many of the tales are set in or near Benares, now called Varanasi, a 
city in north central India on the Ganges River. One of the world's oldest 
cities, Varanasi is the most sacred place for Hindus. Buddhists and 
Muslims also have important religious sites nearby. According to 
tradition, Buddha began his teaching at Sarnath a short distance from this 
city.
