The Bogey Man is so terribly tall,  
The Bogey Man is as high as the wall,  
The Bogey Man is intended to fall  
On violent, truculent folks.  
The Bogey Man is the nurs'ry police,  
There isn't a nephew, nor is there a niece,  
But of whose folly he knows every piece,  
And his horrible wrath it provokes.  
"We told you he'd catch you," my family said,  
When  I  was a youngster; and there by the bed  
He seemed to be standing, all green, blue, and red,  
And every sort of a hue.  
I thought he would leap in the dark with a cry  
And carry me off to his home in the sky --  
But he never did yet, for here still am I --  
So  I  don't believe that it's true.
