A mouse living in the town one day met a mouse which lived in the field.
"Where do you come from?" asked the latter when she saw the town mouse.
 
"I come from yonder town," replied the first mouse.  
"How is life going there with you?"  
"Very well, indeed.  I am living in the lap of luxury.  Whatever I want of
sweets or any other good things is to be found in abundance in my master's
house.  But how are you living?"  
"I have nothing to complain of.  You just come and see my stores.  I have
grain and nuts, and all the fruits of the tree and field in my
storehouse."  
The town mouse did not quite believe the story of her new friend, and,
driven by curiosity, went with her to the latter's house.  How great was
her surprise when she found that the field mouse had spoken the truth; her
garner was full of nuts and grain and other stores, and her mouth watered
when she saw all the riches which were stored up there.  
Then she turned to the field mouse and said, "Oh, yes, you have here a
nice snug place and something to live upon, but you should come to my
house and see what I have there.  Your stock is as nothing compared with
the riches which are mine."  
The field mouse, who was rather simple by nature and trusted her new
friend, went with her into the town to see what better things the other
could have.  She had never been into the town and did not know what her
friend could mean when she boasted of her greater riches.  So they went
together, and the town mouse took her friend to her master's house.  He
was a grocer, and there were boxes and sacks full of every good thing the
heart of a mouse could desire.  When she saw all these riches, the field
mouse said she could never have believed it, had she not seen it with her
own eyes.  
While they were talking together, who should come in but the cat.  As soon
as the town mouse saw the cat, she slipped quietly behind a box and hid
herself.  Her friend, who had never yet seen a cat, turned to her and
asked her who that gentleman was who had come in so quietly.  
"Do you not know who he is?  Why, he is our priest, and he has come to see
me.  You must go and pay your respects to him and kiss his hand.  See what
a beautiful glossy coat he has on, and how his eyes sparkle, and how
demurely he keeps his hands in the sleeves of his coat."  
Not suspecting anything, the field mouse did as she was told and went up
to the cat.  He gave her at once his blessing, and the mouse had no need
of another after that.  The cat gave her extreme unction there and then.
That was just what the town mouse had intended.  When she saw how well
stored the home of the field mouse was, she made up her mind to trap her
and to kill her, so that she might take possession of all that the field
mouse had gathered up.  She had learned the ways of the townspeople and
had acted accordingly.
