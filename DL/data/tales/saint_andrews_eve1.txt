It is believed that on Saint Andrew's Eve, Saint Thomas's Eve, Christmas Eve, and New Year's Eve a maiden can conjure up and see her future beloved. To do so she must set a table for two, but no forks can be included with the untensils. Whatever is left behind by the lover must be carefully set aside. Later he will return to the person who has it and love her passionately. However, he must not see the object, for it would remind him of the torment he endured that night when he had been overcome by supernatural powers. Great misfortune would follow.  
Once in Austria a beautiful maiden wanted to see her future beloved. At midnight, following the necessary rituals, a shoemaker with a dagger appeared to her. He threw the dagger in her direction and then disappeared.  She picked up the dagger and and locked it in her chest.  
Soon afterward the shoemaker came to her and asked her to marry him. Some years after their marriage, on a Sunday after mass, she went to her chest to get some handwork for the following day. Her husband came up to her just as she was opening the chest, and he wanted to see what was inside. She tried to keep him away, but he pushed her aside, looked into the chest, and saw the lost dagger. He picked it up and demanded to know how she came to have the dagger that he had lost some time ago.  
Frightened and confused, she confessed that this was the dagger that he had left with her that night when she had magically seen him.  
With anger he shouted at her: "Whore! So you are the hussy who frightend me so terribly that night!" And he stabbed her through the heart with the dagger.  
This story is told at various places and about different individuals. For example, there is an oral account about a hunter who left his hunting knife. When his wife was recovering from childbirth she sent him to her chest to fetch some bedding, not thinking about the magical item that was there. He found the hunting knife and killed her with it.
