In olden days there were twelve brothers And the eldest brother, the
carpenter Manoli, was making the long bridge. One side he makes; one side
falls. The twelve brothers had one mistress, and they all had to do with
her. 
 The called her to them, "Dear bride." 
 On her head was a tray. In her hands was a child. Whoseso wife came
first. She will come to the twelve brothers. 
 Said his wife, "Thou hast not eaten bread with me. What has befallen
thee that thou eatest not bread with me? My ring has fallen into the
water. Go and fetch my ring." 
 Her husband said, "I will fetch thy ring out of the water." Up to his
two breasts came the water in the depth of the bridge there. He came into
the fountain. He was drowned. Beneath, he became a talisman, the innermost
foundation of the bridge. Manoli's eyes became the great open arch of the
bridge. 
 "God send a wind to blow, that the tray may fall from the head of her
who bears it in front of Lénga." 
 A snake crept out before Lénga, and she feared, and said, "Now
have I fear at sight of the snake, and I am sick. Now is it not bad for my
children?" 
 Another man seized her, and sought to drown her, Manoli's wife.  
 She said, "Drown me not in the water. I have little children." 
 She bowed herself over the sea, where the carpenter Manoli made the
bridge. Another man called Manoli's wife. With him she went on the road.
There, when they went on the road, he went to the tavern. He was weary.
The man went, drank the juice of the grape, got drunk. Before getting
home, he killed Manoli's wife, Lénga.
