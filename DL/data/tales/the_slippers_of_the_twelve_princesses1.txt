I. 
Once on a time, in the good old times, there lived a cow-herd, who had 
neither father nor mother. He was called Jonica, that is to say Johnnie, 
but people had given him the name of  Gura Casca  (open mouth) 
because when he led his cows to pasture, he bellowed at every thing which 
he met on the way. Otherwise he was really a very pretty boy, his face was 
fair, and his, eyes as blue as a morsel of the sky, with hair curling, and 
as yellow as the rays of the sun.   
The young girls of the village teased him sadly. "Hé! Hé! 
Jonica, where are you going with your open mouth?"   
"What does that matter to you?" he would reply tranquilly, and pass on his 
way.   
Though only a cow-herd, he was sufficiently proud of his good looks, and 
he knew quite well the difference between beauty and ugliness, so the 
young peasant girls with their faces and throats tanned by the sun, their 
large hands red and cracked, their feet shod in "opinci" (a rough sort of 
sandal) or other common leather, were not at all to his mind. He had heard 
tell, that, down there, a long way off, in the towns, the young girls were 
quite different; that they had throats as white as alabaster, pink cheeks, 
delicate and soft hands, their small feet covered by satin slippers, that 
in short they were clad in robes of silk and gold, and were called 
princesses. So that, while his comrades only sought to please some rustic 
villager, he dreamed, neither more nor less, that he should marry a 
princess 
 II.  
One noon-day in the middle of August, when the sun was so scorching that 
even the flies did not know where to put themselves, Jonica sat down under 
the shadow of an oak to eat his  mammaliga  (thick Indian meal 
porridge) and a morsel of sheep's milk cheese; seeing that his flock was 
lying peaceably about, he stretched himself at full length, and was soon 
asleep.   
He had a charming dream! A  zina , a fairy, appeared to him, 
beautiful as the day, fresh as a rose, and clad in a robe sparkling with 
diamonds.   
She said to him, "There is a country where precious stones grow; go to the 
court of the emperor who reigns there, and you will marry a princess."   
In the evening, when he took his cows back to the stable, Jonica recounted 
his dream to several of his friends, who freely laughed at him. But the 
words of the  zina  had such an influence on him, that he laughed 
himself at the ridicule of which he was the object.   
The next day, at the same hour, and the same place, our cow-herd came to 
take his siesta. He had the same dream; and the same fairy, more radiant 
than ever, appeared again to him, and repeated, "There is a country where 
precious stones grow; go to the court of the emperor who reigns there and 
you will marry a princess."   
Jonica again repeated his dream, and it was again turned into ridicule. 
  
"What does it matter to me," said Jonica, "if they laugh? I know one 
thing, that if that fairy appears again to me, I'll follow her advice." 
  
On the following day he had the same dream, he got up joyfully, and in the 
evening they heard him in the village singing, "I quit the cows and 
calves, or I am going to marry the daughter of an emperor."   
His master, who overheard him, became thoughtful, but Jonica said to him, 
"You may do, and think as you like, but it is decided! I am going away!" 
  
He began to make his preparations, and in the morning he left. The people 
of the village held their sides with laughing, when they saw him with his 
little bundle on a stick, slung across his shoulder, descend the hill, 
traverse the plain, and then slowly disappear, in the dim distance. 
 III.  
In those days, people did say that there was really a country where 
precious stones grew, as grass, plants, and flowers grow in other places. 
It was said that the emperor of these parts had twelve daughters: twelve 
princesses, the one prettier than the other, but all as proud as they were 
beautiful. It was said also, that they only went to sleep at sunrise, and 
got up at midday. They lived altogether in one large room of the palace, 
and slept in beds of gold, encrusted with flowers of diamonds and 
emeralds.   
When the princesses retired in the evening, the nine doors of their 
apartment were locked outside with nine padlocks. It was impossible for 
them to get out, and yet each night something very extraordinary took 
place.   
The satin slippers of the twelve princesses, were literally worn out each 
morning. One might have thought that the daughters of the emperor had 
danced all night. When they were questioned, they declared that they knew 
nothing, and could understand nothing about it. No one could explain this 
strange fact, for, notwithstanding the greatest watchfulness, not the 
least noise had ever been heard in the chamber of the princesses, after 
they had retired to rest.   
The emperor, their father, was most perplexed, and determined, at any 
price, to penetrate this mystery. He had a trumpet sounded, and it was 
published throughout all the country, that if any one succeeded in finding 
out, by what means his daughters, the princesses, wore out their slippers 
in a single night, he might choose from amongst them, his wife. At this 
news, a great number of emperors' sons, and kings' sons, presented 
themselves to explore this adventure. They hid themselves behind a great 
curtain in the chamber of the princesses. But once there, no one ever 
heard any more of them, and they never reappeared.   
Our Jonica, who arrived just then at the court of the emperor, heard talk 
of all these matters, and succeeded in being taken into the service of one 
of the imperial gardeners, who had been obliged to send away one of his 
best helps. His new master did not find him very intelligent, but he was 
convinced that his curling light hair and good looks, would make him 
acceptable to the princesses.   
Thus his daily duty, then, was each morning to present a bouquet to the 
daughters of the emperor. Jonica posted himself at their door, at the hour 
of their awakening, and as each came forth, he presented her with a 
bouquet. They found the flowers very beautiful, but disdained to cast a 
look or smile on poor Jonica, who remained there more than ever,  Gura 
Casca , open-mouthed.   
Lina, alone, the youngest, the most graceful, and the prettiest of the 
princesses, let fall by hazard on him, a look as soft as velvet. Ah! my 
sisters," cried she, "how good looking our young gardener is!"   
They burst into mocking laughter, and the eldest remarked to Lina, that it 
was unbecoming a princess to lower her eyes to a valet. Nevertheless, 
Jonica intoxicated by the looks and the beauty of Lina, thought of the 
promise of the emperor, and it entered into his head to try and discover 
the mystery of the slippers. He did not mention it to any one though, for 
he was afraid that the emperor might hear of it, be angry, and have him 
driven away from court, as a punishment for his audacity.  
 IV.  
While these thoughts were passing through his brain, Jonica dreamed again 
of the fairy with the sparkling robe. She held in her right hand two small 
laurel branches, one was as red as a cherry, and the other like a rose; in 
her left hand was a little golden spade, a watering can of the same metal, 
and a silken veil. She gave all these to Jonica, saying, "Plant these two 
laurels in large boxes, turn over the earth with this spade, water them 
with this watering can, and wipe them with this silken veil. When they 
have grown three feet high, say to each separately, 'Beautiful laurels, 
with a golden spade I have dug you, with a golden watering can I have 
watered you, and with a silken veil I have wiped you.' This said, you can 
ask anything you wish, and it will be accorded you."   
When Jonica awoke he found the two laurels and the other objects on the 
table, and fell on his knees to thank the good fairy. He at once began to 
carry out her instructions.   
The shrubs grew rapidly, and when they had attained the necessary height, 
he went to the cherry laurel, and said, "Beautiful cherry laurel, with a 
golden spade I have dug you, with a golden can I have watered you, with a 
silken veil I have wiped you; grant me in exchange, the gift of becoming 
invisible whenever I desire."   
Immediately he saw grow out from the laurel, a beautiful white flower. He 
gathered it, placed it in his buttonhole, and at once became invisible. 
  
When night arrived, the princesses went up to their bedroom, and Jonica, 
barefooted, so as to make no noise, glided up behind them, and hid himself 
underneath one of the twelve beds.   
Then, instead of preparing themselves to go to bed, each of the princesses 
opened a wardrobe, and took out their richest dresses and finest jewels. 
Each assisting the other, they dressed  en grande toilette . Jonica 
could see nothing from his hiding place, but he heard them laugh, and 
dance with joy.   
The eldest, who seemed to have great authority over them, hurried them, 
and kept exclaiming, "Be quick, my sisters, our dancers are dying of 
impatience."   
At the end of an hour, the. laughing and talking ceased. Jonica carefully 
put out his head, and saw that the princesses were dressed like fairies. 
They wore quite new satin slippers, and held in their hands the bouquets 
which he had offered to them in the morning.   
They placed themselves one behind the other, and the eldest who was at the 
head, struck three blows in a peculiar manner, on a certain part of the 
wall. A door quite invisible opened, and the princesses disappeared.   
Jonica followed them noiselessly, but by accident he placed his foot on 
the train of the princess Lina.   
"There is someone behind me," she cried. "Someone trod on my dress."   
The eldest turned round quickly, but seeing no one, exclaimed, "How 
foolish you are Lina, you must have caught it against a nail."   
The twelve daughters of the emperor, descended, and descended, and 
descended until they arrived at an underground passage, at the end of 
which was an iron door with a strong bolt.   
The eldest opened this, and then they found themselves in an enchanted 
bower, where the leaves of the trees were in silver, and sparkled in the 
moonlight. They walked on until they came to a second bower, and here the 
trees had golden leaves; still on, and then a third bower, where the 
leaves were of emeralds and rubies and diamonds, and their rays were so 
bright that one might have thought it was full daylight. The princesses 
continued their walk, and (Jonica still following), arrived soon on the 
borders of a large lake.   
On this lake were twelve boats, and in each boat one of the lost sons of 
an emperor, who, oar in hand, each waited for a princess. Jonica took his 
place in the boat of the princess Lina. The boat, being more heavily 
laden, could not float so quickly as the others, and so was always behind. 
  
"I do not know," said Lina to her cavalier, "why we do not go so quickly 
as at other times, what can be the matter?"   
"I do not understand it either," said the emperor's son, "for I row with 
all my force."   
On the other side of the lake the little gardener perceived a beautiful 
palace, illuminated  a giorno , and heard harmonious sounds of 
violins, trumpets and cymbals. The emperors' sons each having a princess 
on his arm entered the palace, and after them came Jonica into a saloon 
lighted by ten lustres.   
The walls were immense mirrors, in gold frames set with precious stones. 
On a centre table a massive golden vase contained an enormous bouquet of 
flowers which gave forth an exquisite perfume. Poor Jonica was literally 
dazed and petrified by the sight of so much splendor. When able to look 
at, and admire the princesses in the midst of this dazzling light, he lost 
his wits completely, and looked so ardently with his eyes, that one would 
have thought that he wished to taste them also with his mouth. Some were 
fair, some were brown, and nearly all of them had let fall their beautiful 
hair down their pretty white shoulders. Never, even in his dreams, had the 
poor boy seen such enchantresses.   
But amongst them all, and above all, it was Lina, who seemed to him the 
most graceful, the most beautiful, the most intoxicating, with her dark 
eyes and long hair -- the shade of a raven's wing. And with what fire she 
danced! Leaning on the shoulder of her cavalier, Lina turned as light as a 
spindle. Her face was flushed, her eyes shone like two stars, and it was 
evident that dancing was her great delight.   
Poor Jonica let fall envious looks on the emperors' sons, and heartily 
regretted not to be on the same footing, so that he also might have had 
the right to be cavalier to such beautiful young creatures. All these 
dancers, to the number of fifty, were emperors' sons who had tried to 
discover the secret of the princesses. These latter had enticed them to a 
midnight expedition, and had given them to drink at table, an enchanted 
beverage, which had frozen their blood, killed in them every sentiment of 
love, every remembrance, or worldly desire, leaving them only the ardent 
pleasure of the dance, in the bosom of this splendid palace, become 
henceforth their eternal habitation.  
 VI.  
The princesses danced until their white satin slippers were in holes, 
until the cock had crowed three times. Then the music ceased, black slaves 
arranged a princely table, which was instantaneously filled with the most 
succulent meats, and the rarest and most exquisite wines. Each one took 
his place, and ate and drank at his ease, excepting our poor  Gura 
Casca , who had to content himself with feasting his eyes alone. When 
the repast was over, the princesses reentered their boat, and Jonica who 
followed them step by step, arrived with them in the wood with the silver 
leaves.   
There, to prove to himself, and to prove also to others, that what he had 
seen was no dream, Jonica broke off a branch of the tree with the 
beautiful leaves. The noise which he made, caused Lina to turn round.   
"What can that be?" said she to her sisters.   
"Probably," said the eldest, "it is the rustling amongst the branches of 
some bird, that has its nest in one of the towers of the palace."   
Jonica then got in advance of the princesses, and mounted rapidly to their 
chamber, opened the window, and glided silently along the trellis which 
covered the wall, and began his daily work.   
While preparing the flowers for the princesses, he hid the branch of 
silver leaves in the bouquet destined for Lina.   
Great was the astonishment of the young girl, who asked herself, in vain, 
how it was possible that the branch could have come there. Without saying 
anything to her sisters, she went down into the garden, and there, under 
the shade of a large chestnut tree, she found the gardener. She had for 
the moment, a great mind to speak to him, but on reflection, thought it 
better to wait a little, and so passed on her way.   
When evening arrived, the princesses again returned to the ball, Jonica 
followed them, and a second time entered Lina's boat. Again the emperor's 
son complained of the labor required in rowing.   
"No doubt it is the heat which you feel," replied Lina.   
All passed as on the previous evening, but this time, on returning, Jonica 
broke off a branch of the golden leaves. When the daily bouquets were 
distributed, the princess Lina found, concealed in hers, the golden 
branch.   
Remaining a little behind her sisters, and showing the golden branch to 
Jonica, she asked, "From whence, hadst thou these leaves?"   
"Your highness knows quite well."   
"So thou hast followed us?"   
"Yes, highness."   
"And how didst thou manage that?"   
"It is a secret."   
"We did not see thee."   
"I was invisible."   
"At any rate, I see that thou hast penetrated the mystery. Speak of it to 
no one, and take this purse as the price of thy silence," and she threw to 
the poor boy, a purse of gold.   
"I do not sell my silence," said Jonica, with a haughtiness which 
astonished the princess.   
"I know how to hold my tongue, without being paid for it." And he walked 
away, leaving the purse on the ground.   
The three succeeding days, Lina neither saw nor heard anything particular, 
during their nocturnal excursions; but the fourth night, there was a 
distinct rustling in the wood of diamond leaves, and the next morning she 
found a diamond branch, hidden in her bouquet.   
Then she was fully convinced that the young gardener knew all their 
escapades, and calling him to her, she asked "Dost thou know the price, 
which the emperor, our father, offers for the discovery of our secret?" 
  
"I know it, highness."   
"Then why dost thou not go to him, and betray it?"   
"I do not wish."   
"Art thou afraid?"   
"No, highness."   
"Then, why wilt thou not speak?"   
Jonica looked up at her, his eyes full of expression, but did not reply. 
 
 VII.  
While Lina was talking with the youth, her sisters were laughing at her, 
and when she came back they still went on with their ridicule, until she 
became quite red with anger.   
"Thou canst marry him," said her sisters, "there is nothing to prevent; 
thou wilt be the gardener's wife, and thou wilt live in the cottage at the 
bottom of the garden. Thou canst help thy husband to draw the water from 
the fountain, and thou canst offer us our daily nosegays."   
Lina became still more angry, and the weight of her anger fell on poor 
Jonica. When he again presented her with flowers, she took them with 
supreme indifference, and treated him with the greatest disdain. The poor 
fellow could not understand it, for he was always most respectful. He 
never dared to look her full in the face, and yet she felt he was present 
with her all day long. At length, she came to the resolution to confide to 
her sisters all that she knew.   
"What!" cried they, "this stupid boy has learned our secret, and thou hast 
kept it from us! We must, at once, absolutely get rid of him."   
"By what means?"   
"Have him stabbed, and thrown into a cave."   
This was the usual way by which troublesome people were disposed of. But 
Lina would not hear of this, saying that the poor boy had committed no 
fault.   
"If you touch a hair of his head," she said, "I will go and confess all to 
our father the emperor."   
To tranquilize Lina, it was decided to get Jonica to go again to the ball, 
and to make him drink the enchanted beverage, which would put him in the 
same state as the other cavaliers.   
So they called the young gardener to them, and the eldest sister asked him 
by what means he had discovered their secret? but he would give them no 
answer. Then they informed him of the decision which they had come to 
respecting him. He replied, that he accepted it, and that he would drink 
willingly the enchanted beverage, so as to become the cavalier of her whom 
he loved.   
On the day fixed, wishing to have as fine clothes, and to be able to make 
as handsome presents as the emperors' sons, Jonica went to the rose 
laurel, and said "my beautiful laurel, I have dug you with a golden spade, 
I have watered you with a golden watering can, I have wiped you with a 
silken veil, grant that, in one moment, I may be as richly dressed as an 
emperor's son."   
Immediately he saw a beautiful flower expand, and gathering it, he was at 
once clad in velvet as dark and soft as Lina's eyes, a toque to match, 
with an agraffe of diamonds, and a flower in his buttonhole. From being 
tanned and brown, his complexion became fair and fresh as an infant's and 
his beauty was marvelous. Even his common, vulgar manner changed 
completely, and any one might have thought him really an emperor's son. 
  
Thus metamorphosed, he presented himself before the emperor, to ask his 
authority to try in his turn, to unravel the secret of the princesses. He 
was so changed that the emperor did not recognize him.   
When the princesses went back to their bedroom, Jonica was waiting for 
them behind the door After their usual excursion, Jonica gave his arm to 
the eldest princess, and afterwards danced with each of the sisters 
successively, and with so much dignity and grace, that they were all 
enchanted. When it was Lina's turn, he was in raptures; but he did not 
address a single word to her.   
While conducting her to her place, the princess said to him, jokingly, 
"Being treated like an emperor's son, thou must be in blissful happiness." 
  
"Never fear, princess," replied he, "you shall not be a gardener's wife." 
  
Lina looked at him, half frightened, but he walked away, without waiting 
for her answer.   
When the princesses had once more danced until their slippers were in 
holes, the music ceased, the black slaves prepared the table as usual, and 
Jonica was placed at the right hand of the eldest princess, and facing 
Lina. He was served with the most delicate meats, the choicest wines; 
compliments and praises were showered on him, but he was neither 
intoxicated by their wines, nor by their flatteries. Presently the eldest 
princess made a sign, and one of the slaves came forward bearing a massive 
golden cup.   
"This enchanted palace has no longer any secrets for thee," cried the 
princess to Jonica. "Let us drink to your triumph!"   
The young man casting a tender glance at Lina, raised the cup to his lips. 
  
"Do not drink it," she cried impetuously. "Do not drink it, I would rather 
be a gardener's wife," and she began to weep. Jonica threw the enchanted 
beverage over his shoulder, cleared the table, and fell on his knees at 
the feet of the princess Lina. All the other emperors' sons fell each at 
the feet of their respective princesses, who choosing them for their 
husbands, held out their hands and raised them from the ground.   
The charm was broken! The twelve couples crossed the lake in boats, 
traversed the forests, passed through the cellar, and arrived at the 
emperor's chamber. Jonica, with the golden cup in his hand, explained to 
him the mystery of the worn-out slippers.   
"God give thee life, young man," said the emperor. "Take thy choice from 
amongst my daughters."   
"My choice has been made for a long time," said he, taking by the hand the 
princess Lina, who blushed and could not look up.  
 IX.  
The princess Lina did not become a gardener's wife, for Jonica became a 
prince. Before their marriage took place, Lina enquired of him, how he had 
discovered their secret. Jonica showed her the two laurels. Lina, like an 
intelligent woman, thought that Jonica would have too great an advantage 
over her, if he enjoyed the power which was given to him by possessing 
these shrubs, so she tore the laurels up by their roots and flung them 
into the fire.   
A short time afterwards, the marriage took place with imperial splendor. 
It was followed by festivities which lasted three days and three nights, 
and the young people lived very happily together, to a good old age.
