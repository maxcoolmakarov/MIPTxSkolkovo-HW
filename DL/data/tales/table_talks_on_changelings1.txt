The Story of a Changeling at Dessau 
Eight years ago [in the year 1532] at Dessau, I, Dr. Martin Luther, saw 
and touched a changeling.  It was twelve years old, and from its eyes and 
the fact that it had all of its senses, one could have thought that it 
was a real child.  It did nothing but eat; in fact, it ate enough for any 
four peasants or threshers.  It ate, shit, and pissed, and whenever 
someone touched it, it cried.  When bad things happened in the house, it 
laughed and was happy; but when things went well, it cried.  It had these 
two virtues.  I said to the Princes of Anhalt: "If I were the prince or 
the ruler here, I would throw this child into the water--into the Molda 
that flows by Dessau.  I would dare commit  homicidium  on him!"  
But the Elector of Saxony, who was with me at Dessau, and the Princes of 
Anhalt did not want to follow my advice.  Therefore, I said: "Then you 
should have all Christians repeat the Lord's Prayer in church that God 
may exorcise the devil."  They did this daily at Dessau, and the 
changeling child died in the following year....  Such a changeling child 
is only a piece of flesh, a  massa carnis,  because it has no soul.
