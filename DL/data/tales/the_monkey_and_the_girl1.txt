Once upon a time the boys and girls of a village used to watch the
crops of  but  [a kind of grain] growing by a river, and there was a
Hanuman monkey who wished to eat the  but , but they drove him away.
 So he made a plan. He used to make a garland of flowers and go with it
to the field, and, when he was driven away, he would leave the flowers
behind. And the children were pleased with the flowers and ended by making
friends with the monkey and did not drive him away.
 There was one of the young girls who was fascinated by the monkey and
promised to marry him. Some of the other children told this in the
village, and the girl's father and mother came to hear of it and were
angry, and the father took some of the villagers and went and shot the
monkey.
 Then they decided not to throw away the body, but to burn it like the
corpse of a man. So they made a pyre and put the body on it and set fire
to it. Just then the girl came, and they told her to go away, but she said
that she wished to see whether they really burned him like a man. So she
stood by, and when the pyre was in full blaze, she called out, "Oh look
what is happening to the stars in the sky!"
 At this everyone looked up at the sky. Then she took some sand which
she had in the fold of her cloth and threw it into the air, and it fell
into their eyes and blinded them.
 While they were rubbing the sand out of their eyes the girl leapt onto
the pyre, and was burned along with the monkey and died a  sati
 [also spelled  suttee  -- a Hindu widow's suicidal cremation on
her husband's funeral pyre as a demonstration of devotion]. Her father and
brothers were very angry at this and said that the girl must have had a
monkey's soul, and so she was fascinated by him. And so saying they bathed
and went home.
