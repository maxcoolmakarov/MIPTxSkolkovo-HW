Once there were so many mice and rats in Freistadt that no one knew what to do about them. Then a "herder" presented himself, claiming to be able to drive away the vermin. He stood in the marketplace and blew into his horn. The longer he blew, the more mice and rats crawled forth out of holes in the walls, cellar windows, and so forth.  
Finally he set forth out of the town, blowing his horn. The vermin followed him until he came to a pond. He waded in as far as he could, and they swam after him. Finally he stopped blowing his horn, and all the swimmers sank.
