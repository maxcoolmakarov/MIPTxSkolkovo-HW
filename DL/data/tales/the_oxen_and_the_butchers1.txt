Once upon a time the oxen determined to be revenged upon the butchers for 
the havoc they wrought in their ranks, and 

plotted to put them to death on a given day. They were all gathered 
together discussing how best to carry out the 

plan, and the more violent of them were engaged in sharpening their horns 
for the fray, when an old ox got up upon his 

feet and said, "My brothers, you have good reason, I know, to hate these 
butchers, but, at any rate, they understand 

their trade and do what they have to do without causing unnecessary pain. 
But if we kill them, others, who have no 

experience, will be set to slaughter us, and will by their bungling 
inflict great sufferings upon us. For you may be 

sure that even though all the butchers perish, mankind will never go 
without their beef."
