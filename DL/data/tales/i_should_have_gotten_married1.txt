Once there was a woman who had a child whom she abandoned outside to die. Later she had another child, a little girl. She did not abandon this girl, who grew up until she was of marriageable age. A man asked her to marry him. Many people were at the wedding. In the middle of the festivities they heard someone chanting through the window: 
  
I should have come of age,  
And had a suitor too,  
I should have gotten married,  
Just like you.
  
The guests thought that this verse was meant for the bride and that it was sung by her sister, who had been abandoned outside to die.
