Her beauty was her undoing.  Lorelei was not willfully seductive, but men 
could not resist her charms, and she could not resist their advances.  
She was bringing scandal and disgrace to the respectable town of 
Bacharach-on-the-Rhine. 
There was even talk that she must be a witch or a woman possessed of the 
devil.  The bishop, however, would not hear of an execution without due 
process, and he summoned her to his court.  His questions were at first 
stern and severe.  Her answers were simple and sincere.  The bishop's 
severity, his piety, and his priesthood, however, did not prevail, and in 
the end he pronounced her free of all guilt. 
"I cannot continue like this!" she cried.  "My eyes are the destruction 
of every man who looks into them.  I have loved only one man, and he 
abandoned me and left for a distant land.  Please let me die!" 
But the good bishop could not bring himself to pronounce a death 
sentence.  Instead, he proposed that she dedicate herself to God, and 
called three knights to accompany her to the convent.  Arrangements were 
made forthwith, and the three knights were soon underway with their 
beautiful ward. 
When their path led them past a high cliff overlooking the Rhine, Lorelei 
had one last request of her escorts.  "Please," she said, "let me climb 
the cliff and have one last look into the Rhine."  Unable to deny her 
this wish, the three knights tethered their horses, and the four of them 
climbed to the top of the cliff. 
Standing at the edge of the precipice, Lorelei said, "See that boat on 
the Rhine.  The boatman is my lover!"  And with no further warning, she 
jumped from the cliff into the Rhine. 
The three knights also met their death there, without a priest and 
without a grave. 
 
Who is the singer of this song? 
A boatman on the Rhine, 
And we always hear the echo 
Of the Three-Knight-Stone: 
 
Lorelei 
Lorelei 
Lorelei 
 
As though there were three of us.
