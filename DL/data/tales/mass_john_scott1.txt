A Mass John Scott, minister of Peebles, is reported to have been the last 
renowned exorciser, and to have lost his life in a contest with an 
obstinate spirit. This was owing to the conceited rashness of a young 
clergyman, who commenced the ceremony of laying the ghost before the 
arrival of Mass John. It is the nature, it seems, of spirits disembodied, 
as well as embodied, to increase in strength and presumption, in 
proportion to the advantages which they may gain over the opponent. The 
young clergyman losing courage, the horrors of the scene were increased to 
such a degree, that, as Mass John approached the house in which it passed, 
he beheld the slates and tiles flying from the roof, as if dispersed with 
a whirlwind. At his entry, be perceived all the wax tapers (the most 
essential instruments or conjuration) extinguished, except one, which 
already burned blue in the socket. The arrival of the experienced sage 
changed the scene: he brought the spirit to reason; but unfortunately, 
while addressing a word or advice or censure to his rash brother, he 
permitted the ghost to obtain the last word, a circumstance which, in all 
colloquies of this nature, is strictly to be guarded against. This fatal 
oversight occasioned his falling into a lingering disorder, of which be 
never recovered.
