It is very noteworthy that there are no rats at all in the city of
Neustadt-Eberswalde. The explanation is as follows:
 In earlier times there were a great many rats there, especially in the
town's grain mill, where they caused much damage. In about the year 1607
or 1608 a certain man presented himself to the council and offered to get
rid of these vermin, claiming that no rats would return to the mill as
long as it should stand. He did not ask for even the slightest payment
until one year after he had done away with the rats. At that time his
charge would be ten thalers, which was promised to him. The magistrate had
him paid two thalers in advance.
 The man then placed something in the mill and something else in a
secret place. The following day the people saw with amazement how the rats
left the mill in a great swarm and swam out into the Finow River, that
flows by there. Not a single rat was left behind.
 A year later the man returned to collect the eight thalers that were
still owed him, and he was paid. From that time forth no trace of a rat
has been seen there, neither in the mill, nor in the city.
