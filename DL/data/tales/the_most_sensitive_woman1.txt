The parents of a prince wanted him to marry, but he said, "I will marry
only such a woman about whom I can say with good conscience that she is
the most sensitive woman in the world." 
 His parents answered, "Then go and find her!" 
 He went forth and came to a woman whose head was all bandaged up and
who appeared to be suffering. "What is the matter with you?" he asked. 
 "Oh," she said, "this morning my maid was combing my hair, and she
pulled one out, which is causing me great pain." 
 But the prince thought to himself, "She isn't the right one. I will
seek further." 
 He went on his way and found another woman. Her entire body was wrapped
with the finest linen, and she looked very sad. "What is the matter with
you?" he asked. 
 "Oh," she said, "last night while I was in bed there was a little
wrinkle in the sheet I was lying on, and it has made me sick." 
 But the prince thought, "She is not the most sensitive one either.
There must be a better one." 
 He continued on his way and came to a third woman. She was sitting in
an easy chair and had a bandaged foot. She was crying bright tears and was
distorting her pretty face until one had to feel sorry for her. "What is
the matter with you?" asked the prince. 
 "Oh," she groaned, "this morning while I was strolling in the garden a
little breeze came up and blew the petal of a jasmine blossom onto my
foot." 
 The prince thought about this a little while, and then said, "You are
the right one, for there cannot be a more sensitive woman than you!" And
he married her. 
 Did he do the right thing? Unfortunately the storyteller does not know,
for she has run out of yarn.
