Once upon a time there was a married couple who lived peacefully with each 
other. This irritated the devil, so he went to an old woman in the village 
and said to her, "If you can bring discord between these two married 
people, you shall have a pair of leather slippers."     
She said, "We shall see."     
Then she went to the wife when she was home alone and said, "Do you have a 
good husband, and do you get along well with him?"     
"Yes," she answered, "I could never find a better husband in my whole 
life."     
"Good," said the old woman. "I will tell you a means of guaranteeing that 
you will never quarrel with him. This evening, after he has gone to bed 
and fallen asleep, take a knife and cut off a few of the hairs that grow 
on his Adam's apple. If you do that, you will never quarrel with one 
another."     
Then she left the house and went to the husband in the field and said to 
him, "Do you have a very good wife?"     
"Yes," said the husband.     
"Oh," replied the old woman, "I would not trust womenfolk. Don't trust 
your wife too much. You should know that tonight while you are asleep she 
intends to slit your throat."     
The husband took notice of this, and that evening he pretended to be 
asleep. He did indeed see that his wife was silently approaching him with 
a knife. Then he jumped up, ripped the knife from her hand, and slit her 
throat.     
When the devil brought the red leather slippers to the old woman he held 
them out to her on a long beanpole.    
The old woman asked, "Why are you doing that?"     
"You are much, much worse that I am," said the devil, "and not worthy for 
me to give you the slippers with my hand."
