There was a man from Als who found a treasure in a strange manner. One night he dreamed that he would find a treasure on a street in Flensburg. Relying on this, he went there.  He walked about in the streets of Flensburg, but could not comprehend how he might find a treasure there.  
A Flensburger came to him and asked why he was walking about like that.  
He told the man about his dream, but the Flensburger laughed at him, saying, "In that case I should go to Tanslet on the island of Als, for last night I dreamed that a treasure was buried there."  
To this the man said nothing, but immediately returned to Als, and in Tanslet he found the treasure that he had intended to find on a street in Flensburg.
