In the western part of Cornwall, all the marks of any peculiar kind found
on the rocks are referred either to the giants or the devil.  In the
eastern part of the county such markings are almost always attributed to
Arthur. 
Not far from the Devil's Coit in St. Columb, on the edge of the Gossmoor,
there is a large stone upon which are deeply impressed marks, which a
little fancy may convert into the marks of four horseshoes.  This is "King
Arthur's Stone," and these marks were made by the horse upon which the
British king rode when he resided at Castle Denis, and hunted on these
moors.  King Arthur's bed, and chair, and caves, are frequently to be met
with. 
The Giant's Coits, -- and many traditions of these will be found in the
section devoted to the giant romances -- are probably monuments of the
earliest types of rock mythology.  Those of Arthur belong to the period
when the Britons were so far advanced in civilization as to war under
experienced rulers; and those which are appropriated by the devil are
evidently instances of the influence of priestcraft [Roman Catholicism] on
the minds of an impressible people.
