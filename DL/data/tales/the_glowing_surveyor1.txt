A surveyor near Farsum was very dishonest during his lifetime.  Whenever he measured a plot of land he accepted a bribe in order to make the plot larger than it should have been. For this reason he was cursed, and after his death he has to go about as a glowing man with a glowing surveyor's chain. Thus is he is measuring land every night, even to this day.
