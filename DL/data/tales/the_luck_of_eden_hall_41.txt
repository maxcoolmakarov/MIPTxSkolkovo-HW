The elves were hospitable. They liked their human neighbours to eat, drink, and be merry with them. Endless tales are told of them biding their big neighbours, who strayed in among them while they were carousing, to partake of their feast. A goblet in which they were drinking a "richt gude willie waught" in their sovereign's honour roused the envy of a Musgrave. He rushed in, seized the glass, mounted in hot haste and galloped away with his stolen trophy.  
Some authorities hold that the good folk are not averse to crossing running water. It is only a wicked class of them whose powers are blunted by traversing flowing streams. But legend tells us Musgrave pressed his steed towards the brook, for he knew if once he forded it, the rain of fairy flints showered at him, and all pursuit, would cease. His terrified courser, spurred by steel and fear, leapt the water.  
Safe across the river he paused, and borne on the breeze, Musgrave heard his despoiled pursuers forgivingly sing:
 
Joy to thy banner, bold Sir Knight,  
But if yon goblet break or fall,  
Farewell thy vantage in the fight.  
Farewell the luck of Eden Hall.
 
In the Musgraves' Cumberland home the illicitly-obtained "luck" -- a glass goblet -- remains intact, carefully preserved.
