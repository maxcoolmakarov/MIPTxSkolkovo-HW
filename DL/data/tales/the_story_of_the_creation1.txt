In the very beginning there lived a being so large that he cannot be 
compared with any known thing. His name was Melu, and when he sat on the 
clouds, which were his home, he occupied all the space above. His teeth 
were pure gold, and because he was very cleanly and continually rubbed 
himself with his hands, his skin became pure white. The dead skin which he 
rubbed off his body was placed on one side in a pile, and by and by this 
pile became so large that he was annoyed and set himself to consider what 
he could do with it.   
Finally Melu decided to make the earth; so he worked very hard in putting 
the dead skin into shape, and when it was finished he was so pleased with 
it that he determined to make two beings like himself, though smaller, to 
live on it.   
Taking the remnants of the material left after making the earth he 
fashioned two men, but just as they were all finished except their noses, 
Tau Tana from below the earth appeared and wanted to help him.   
Melu did not wish any assistance, and a great argument ensued. Tau Tana 
finally won his point and made the noses which he placed on the people 
upside down. When all was finished, Melu and Tau Tana whipped the forms 
until they moved. Then Melu went to his home above the clouds, and Tau 
Tana returned to his place below the earth.   
All went well until one day a great rain came, and the people on the earth 
nearly drowned from the water which ran off their heads into their noses. 
Melu, from his place on the clouds, saw their danger, and he came quickly 
to earth and saved their lives by turning their noses the other side up. 
  
The people were very grateful to him, and promised to do anything he 
should ask of them. Before he left for the sky, they told him that they 
were very unhappy living on the great earth all alone, so he told them to 
save all the hair from their heads and the dry skin from their bodies and 
the next time he came he would make them some companions. And in this way 
there came to be a great many people on the earth.
