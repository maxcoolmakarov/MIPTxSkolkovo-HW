When Doctor Faust was lying on his deathbed he called to his servant and gave him the following order: "After I have died, cut my body into small pieces. Put everything into a tub and press it all firmly together."  
Furthermore, the servant was carefully to close all shutters and windows, such that not even the smallest crack remained open.  The tub was to be placed behind the stove, which was to be heated glowing hot for three days.  
The servant was strictly commanded not to enter the room until the three days had passed.  He followed these orders. On the third day the smell was so strong that he could no longer stand it, and he looked into the room.  Doctor Faust's head and breast emerged from the tub, and he waved to the servant.  A moment later he climbed out the the tub, whole and hearty.
