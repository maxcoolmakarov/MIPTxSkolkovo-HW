There was a bald man, with a head like a copper pot. And he, being a fool, was ashamed because, though a rich man in the world, he had no hair on his head.  
Then a rogue, who lived upon others, came to him and said, "There is a physician who knows a drug that will produce hair."  
When he heard it, he said, "If you bring him to me, I will give wealth to you and to that physician also."  
When he said this, the rogue for a long time devoured his substance, and brought to that simpleton a doctor who was a rogue also. And after the doctor too had long lived at his expense, he one day removed his head-dress designedly, and shewed him his bald head.  
In spite of that, the blockhead, without considering, asked him for a drug which would produce hair, then the physician said to him, "Since I am bald myself, how can I produce hair in others? It was in order to explain this to you, that I showed you my bald head. But out on you! You do not understand even now."  
With these words the physician went away.  
So, you see, rogues perpetually make sport of fools.
