When the great king of all the tigers was sick, the tiger crown prince 
made obeisance and said, "If my lord will taste 

of the flesh of every beast of the field peradventure my lord may 
recover." 
 To the great king commanded the crown prince to summon every kind of 
beast into his presence, and as they 

appeared, the king ate them. Only the mouse-deer, who was likewise 
summoned, refused to appear. Therefore the great 

king's wrath was kindled against the mouse-deer, and in the end he too was 
fain to appear. And when he appeared he 

was questioned by the king, "Why did you not attend at the first when we 
had summoned hither every kind of beast that 

lives in the field?" 
 The mouse-deer replied, "Your slave could not approach your majesty 
because of a dream of certain medicine that 

would make your majesty well." 
 The king replied, "What medicine was this of which you dreamed?" 
 "Your slave dreamed that the only remedy for you majesty's sickness was 
for you majesty to seize and devour  that 

which is nearest your majesty ." 
 Immediately on hearing this, the great king of the tigers seized the 
prince of the tigers and devoured him also. And 

straightway the king was cured, and the mouse-deer himself became crown 
prince in turn.
