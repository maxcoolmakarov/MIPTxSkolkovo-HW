Table Talk 
A certain man complained to Dr. Martin Luther about his misery. He had provided generously for his children, indeed, he had transferred all of his property over to them, but now, in his old age, they had abandoned him.  
The doctor replied:  
Jesus Sirach [Ben Sira] gives parents the best advice when he says: "Do not give everything away while you are still alive, for then your children will not be faithful to you."  
As the proverb states: "One father can care for ten children, but ten children cannot care for one father."  
For this reason in times past there were many sermons about a children's thanklessness. Their father made made his last will and testament, then locked it into a chest together with a club and a slip of paper. On the slip of paper were these words:  
 
 
 
  Welcher Vater das Seine gibet aus der Gewalt,  
Den soll man todtschlagen mit der Keule bald.  
 
  A father who gives all away before he's dead  
Should be dispatched with a blow to his head.
