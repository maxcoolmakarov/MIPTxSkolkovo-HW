Once upon a time all the mice met together in council and discussed the 
best means of securing themselves against the 

attacks of the cat. After several suggestions had been debated, a mouse of 
some standing and experience got up and 

said, "I think I have hit upon a plan which will ensure our safety in the 
future, provided you approve and carry it 

out. It is that we should fasten a bell round the neck of our enemy the 
cat, which will by its tinkling warn us of her 

approach." This proposal was warmly applauded, and it had been already 
decided to adopt it, when an old mouse got upon 

his feet and said, "I agree with you all that the plan before us is an 
admirable one. But may I ask who is going to 

bell the cat?"
