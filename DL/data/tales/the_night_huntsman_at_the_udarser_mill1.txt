It is said that the Night Huntsman haunts the vicinity of the Udarser 
Mill.  Once a mill worker who had spent the night at the mill heard the 
Night Huntsman passing by with great commotion, shouting "Halloo!"  The 
worker had heard a lot about the Night Huntsman's sinister deeds, and he 
wanted to know more about him, so he went out onto the mill platform and 
heartily added his voice to the wild noise.  Suddenly he heard a voice 
calling out: 
 
If you want to hunt, 
You can join the ride!
 
At the same time someone threw a woman's leg at the worker, a woman's leg 
wearing a red shoe.  The worker quickly retreated into the mill.  It is 
said that the next morning he buried the leg beneath the mill platform.
