The inhabitants of the little town of Naumburg, near the border of the
Waldeck District, built a church for the praise of God and and the
salvation of their souls, for there was not yet one at that place.  The
devil, from a vantage point on a mountain near Züschen watched
angrily as the pious work progressed from day to day.  Finally he could no
longer contain his anger; he picked up a huge stone, wanting to throw it
at Naumburg.  However, it got caught on his sleeve and fell into a field
between Züschen and Naumburg.  The Evil One went there, sat down on
the stone, and wept bloody tears because of his failed throw.  The stone
is still there, and is known by the name  Riesenstein  (Giant's Stone).  You
can still see where the devil sat and the three red stains which are said
to have come from his bloody tears.
