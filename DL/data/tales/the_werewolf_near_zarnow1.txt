In the vicinity of Zarnow a few years ago a terrible wolf was on the 
loose and was causing great harm to humans and cattle.  Once he even 
ripped a child to pieces.  Then all the peasants of the region banded 
together and pursued him, finally surrounding him in some brush.  They 
were about to kill him when suddenly a large strange man with a club 
appeared before them.  Then they knew that they had a werewolf before 
them.  This happened in the year 1831.
