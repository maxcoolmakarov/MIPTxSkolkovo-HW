A teamster driving along Brenner Lake heard a voice calling out from the 
water, "Time is up, and the person is not here yet." He paid little heed 
to the voice and drove his horses onward. Then he met a fisherman who was 
walking down to the lake to fish. The teamster warned him and told him 
what he had heard. Following the teamster's advice, the fisherman changed 
his plans and accompanied the teamster to the Brenner tavern. However, the 
fisherman had scarcely taken the first bite of bread into his mouth when 
he collapsed dead onto the floor.
