In the entire region between the Deister River and the Weser River they
tell
about the böxenwolf who at nighttime preys upon travelers, making
them
carry him part of the way.  Such a böxenwolf is actually a human who
transforms himself and gains superhuman strength by putting on a strap. 
Late one evening two peasants were returning home from a mill not far from
Rinteln.  Each was carrying a sack of flour.  A böxenwolf confronted
one of
them.  He immediately called out for help to his companion, who threw down
his
sack and attacked the böxenwolf so furiously with his stick, that the
böxenwolf turned and fled. 
The next day they went to another peasant.  They had long suspected him,
because
was rich, but no one knew the source of his wealth.  He was lying in bed,
deathly ill.  He had the surgeon come and bind his wounds.  Thus they
discovered
who had been the böxenwolf.
