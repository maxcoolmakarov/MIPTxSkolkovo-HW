Not too many years ago Gypsies would pass through Holstein and then set up their camp in the marshland near Kolmar [Chodzież]. According to legend they would drown their very old people who were no longer able to keep up with them and were only useless burdens. As they pushed them alive under the water they would chant this verse:  
 
 
 
  Duuk ünner, duuk ünner;  
De Weld is di gramm.  
 
  Duck under, duck under;  
The world is misery for you.
