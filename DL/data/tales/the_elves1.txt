Children's and Household Tales  
A mother had her child taken from the cradle by elves.  In its place they 
laid a changeling with a thick head and staring eyes who would do nothing 
but eat and drink.  In distress she went to a neighbor and asked for 
advice.  The neighbor told her to carry the changeling into the kitchen, 
set it on the hearth, make a fire, and boil water in two eggshells.  That 
should make the changeling laugh, and if he laughs it will be all over 
with him.  The woman did everything just as her neighbor said.  When she 
placed the eggshells filled with water over the fire, the blockhead said:
  
 
Now I am as old  
As the Wester Wood,  
But have never seen anyone cooking in shells! 
 
 
And he began laughing about it.  When he laughed, a band of little elves 
suddenly appeared.  They brought the rightful child, set it on the 
hearth, and took the changeling away.
