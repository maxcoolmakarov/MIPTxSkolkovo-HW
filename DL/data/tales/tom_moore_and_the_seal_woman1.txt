Apropos of the following tale, I may say: The intermarriage with and 
descent of men from beings not human touches upon one of the most 
interesting and important points in primitive belief. Totemism among 
savage races in our day, and descent from the gods in antiquity are the 
best examples of this belief; derived from it, in all probability but 
remotely, are family escutcheons with their animals and birds and the 
emblematic beasts and birds of nations, such as the Roman eagle, the 
British lion, the American eagle, the Russian bear. The Roman eagle and 
the wolf which suckled Romulus may have been totems, if not for the 
Romans, at least for some earlier people. The lion, eagle, and bear of 
England, America, and Russia are of course not totemic, though adopted in 
imitation of people who, if they had not totems, had as national emblems 
birds or beasts that at some previous period were real totems for some 
social body.  
There is a tale in Scotland concerning people of the clan MacCodrum, who 
were seals in the daytime, but men and women at night. No man of the 
MacCodrums, it is said, would kill a seal. The MacCodrums are mentioned in 
Gaelic as "Clann Mhic Codruim nan rón" (Clan MacCodrum of the 
seals).  
 
In the village of Kilshanig, two miles northeast of Castlegregory, there 
lived at one time a fine, brave young man named Tom Moore, a good dancer 
and singer. 'Tis often he was heard singing among the cliffs and in the 
fields of a night.  
Tom's father and mother died, and he was alone in the house and in need of 
a wife. One morning early, when he was at work near the strand, he saw the 
finest woman ever seen in that part of the kingdom, sitting on a rock, 
fast asleep. The tide was gone from the rocks then, and Tom was curious to 
know who was she or what brought her, so he walked toward the rock.  
"Wake up!" cried Tom to the woman. "If the tide comes 'twill drown you." 
 
She raised her head and only laughed. Tom left her there, but as he was 
going he turned every minute to look at the woman. When he came back be 
caught the spade, but couldn't work; he had to look at the beautiful woman 
on the rock. At last the tide swept over the rock. He threw the spade down 
and away to the strand with him, but she slipped into the sea and he saw 
no more of her that time.  
Tom spent the day cursing himself for not taking the woman from the rock 
when it was God that sent her to him. He couldn't work out the day. He 
went home.  
Tom could not sleep a wink all that night. He was up early next morning 
and went to the rock. The woman was there. He called to her.  
No answer. He went up to the rock. "You may as well come home with me 
now," said Tom. Not a word from the woman. Tom took the hood from her head 
and said, "I'll have this!"  
The moment be did that she cried, "Give back my hood, Tom Moore!"  
"Indeed I will not, for 'twas God sent you to me, and now that you have 
speech I'm well satisfied!" And taking her by the arm he led her to the 
house. The woman cooked breakfast, and they sat down together to eat it. 
 
"Now," said Tom, "in the name of God you and I'll go to the priest and get 
married, for the neighbors around here are very watchful; they'd be 
talking." So after breakfast they went to the priest, and Tom asked him to 
marry them.  
"Where did you get the wife?" asked the priest.  
Tom told the whole story. When the priest saw Tom was so anxious to marry 
be charged £5, and Tom paid the money. He took the wife home with 
him, and 
she was as good a woman as ever went into a man's house. She lived with 
Tom seven years, and had three sons and two daughters.  
One day Tom was plowing, and some part of the plow rigging broke. He 
thought there were bolts on the loft at home, so he climbed up to get 
them. He threw down bags and ropes while he was looking for the bolts, and 
what should he throw down but the hood which he took from the wife seven 
years before. She saw it the moment it fell, picked it up, and hid it. At 
that time people heard a great seal roaring out in the sea.  
"Ah," said Tom's wife, "that's my brother looking for me."  
Some men who were hunting killed three seals that day. All the women of 
the village ran down to the strand to look at the seals, and Tom's wife 
with the others. She began to moan, and going up to the dead seals she 
spoke some words to each and then cried out, "Oh, the murder!" 
When they saw her crying the men said, "We'll have nothing more to do with 
these seals."  
So they dug a great hole, and the three seals were put into it and 
covered. But some thought in the night, "'Tis a great shame to bury those 
seals, after all the trouble in taking them." Those men went with shovels 
and dug up the earth, but found no trace of the seals.  
All this time the big seal in the sea was roaring. Next day when Tom was 
at work his wife swept the house, put everything in order, washed the 
children and combed their hair; then, taking them one by one, she kissed 
each. She went next to the rock, and, putting the hood on her head, gave a 
plunge. That moment the big seal rose and roared so that people ten miles 
away could hear him. Tom's wife went away with the seal swimming in the 
sea. All the five children that she left had webs between their fingers 
and toes, halfway to the tips.  
The descendants of Tom Moore and the seal woman are living near 
Castlegregory to this day, and the webs are not gone yet from between 
their fingers and toes, though decreasing with each generation.
