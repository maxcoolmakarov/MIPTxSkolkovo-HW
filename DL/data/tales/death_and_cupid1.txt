Cupid, one sultry summer's noon, tired with play and faint with heat, went 
into a cool grotto to repose himself. This 

happened to be the cave of Death. He threw himself carelessly down upon 
the floor, and his quiver turning upside down, 

all the arrows fell out and mingled with those of Death, which lay 
scattered about the place. When he awoke he 

gathered them up as well as he could; but they were so intermingled that 
although he knew the proper number to take, 

he could not rightly distinguish his own. Hence he took up some of the 
arrows which belonged to Death, and left some 

of his. This is the reason why that we now and then see the hearts of the 
old and decrepit transfixed with the bolts 

of Love; and with great grief and surprise sometimes see youth and beauty 
smitten with the darts of Death.  
 Moral: Death and Love strike unexpectedly.
