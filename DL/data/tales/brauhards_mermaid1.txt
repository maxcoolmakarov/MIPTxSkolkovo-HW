Many years ago a man named Brauhard lived in Lauterberg. He had been
far away across the water and had brought home a mermaid, whom he married.
Her top half was human, but her bottom half was formed like a fish. She
lived in a tub in his house. However, his friends could not stand the
malformed woman, and so they finally poisoned her. He did not remarry, and
he contributed the money he had received as her dowry to the poor. That is
the source of the Brauhard Fund which to this day is administered by the
Scharzfeld Jurisdiction for the support of the poor in the surrounding
villages.
