In olden, olden times, the land of Hessen was surrounded by great
forests which were inhabited by many wolves. Many a family of goats
attempted to enter the land, but were torn apart by the bloodthirsty
beasts. One day a weak little kid goat was making his way toward Hessen.
He had hardly entered the forest before a wolf confronted him and wanted
to tear him to pieces. 
 Filled with fear, the little kid said, "My mother is coming too." 
 The wolf thought, "Don't spoil your appetite. The mother will be a
better meal for my hungry stomach." And he let the little animal pass in
peace. 
 Sure enough, soon afterward the mother goat appeared. The wolf was
about to pounce on her, when she -- filled with fear -- said, "My husband
is coming too." 
 "Stop!" thought the wolf. "Her husband is larger and will be a better
meal for you. Wait to eat until he comes." 
 Finally the ram goat approached. The wolf's heart laughed inside his
body when he saw the stately fellow. He was about to spring on him and
grab him by the throat when two things caught his attention: the ram's
spikes and his bag. 
 "Tell me, ram," what are those big spikes on your head, and what is
that bag for between your legs?" 
 "Oh," replied the ram, "the spikes are a pair of pistols, and the bag
is where I carry my powder and lead." 
 In that moment, as such animals often do, the ram rubbed his left horn
against his flank. The wolf thought that he was loading his pistol, and he
took to flight. Thus the first family of goats arrived happily in the land
of Hessen. Their descendents have multiplied so much that Hessen now
provides the neighboring lands with its surplus every year.
