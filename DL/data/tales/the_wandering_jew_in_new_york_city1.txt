A sensation was created in William street, on Thursday morning, by the appearance of a man on the pave with a long floating beard, and dressed in loose pantaloons, with a turban on his head. He carried in his hand a little manuscript Hebrew book, out of which he read to the crowd which gathered around him.  
He represented himself as the veritable Wandering Jew. Nobody knows who he is or where he came from. 
A learned Jewish rabbi was sent to converse with him, which they did in the Hebrew language, and the stranger was found to be perfect in his knowledge of that most difficult tongue.  
The Rabbi tested him in the Arabic, the Phenician, and in the Sanscrit, but soon found that the aged stranger far surpassed him in intimacy with them all.  
The Rabbi invited him to his house; but, said the stranger, "nay, I cannot stop. The Crucified of Calvary has pronounced the edict, and I must not rest. I must move on -- ever on!"  
He was last seen on Thursday, but to where he has departed no one can tell.
