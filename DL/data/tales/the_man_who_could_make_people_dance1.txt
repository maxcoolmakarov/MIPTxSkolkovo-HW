Once upon a time a man lived in Inagh who had a charm for making people dance. He was in no friends with Father Grace because the latter had tried to make him give up the charm. One day Father Grace came to his house and the man set the charm as soon as he saw him. Father Grace was dancing all the whole day and in the end he was ready to fall he was so tired.  
Then he asked the man to undo the charm. "In the honour of God."  
The man then is stopped from dancing with black ass blood and a raven's feather.
