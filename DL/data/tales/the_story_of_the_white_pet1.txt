There was a farmer before now who had a White Pet (sheep), and when
Christmas was drawing near, he thought that he would kill the White Pet.
The White Pet heard that, and he thought he would run away; and that is
what he did. 
 He had not gone far when a bull met him. Said the bull to him, "All
hail! White Pet, where are you going?" 
 "I," said the White Pet, "am going to seek my fortune; they were going
to kill me for Christmas, and I thought I had better run away." 
 "It is better for me," said the bull, "to go with you, for they were
going to do the very same with me." 
 "I am willing," said the White Pet; "the larger the party the better
the fun." 
 They went forward until they fell in with a dog. "All hail! White Pet,"
said the dog. 
 "All hail! dog." 
 "Where are you going?" said the dog. 
 "I am running away, for I heard that they were threatening to kill me
for Christmas." 
 "They were going to do the very same to me," said the dog, "and I will
go with you." 
 "Come, then," said the White Pet. 
 They went then, until a cat joined them. "All hail! White Pet," said
the cat. 
 "All hail! oh cat." 
 "Where are you going?" said the cat. 
 "I am going to seek my fortune," said the White Pet, " because they
were going to kill me at Christmas." 
 "They were talking about killing me too," said the cat," and I had
better go with you." 
 "Come on then," said the White Pet. 
 Then they went forward until a cock met them. "All hail! White Pet,"
said the cock. 
 "All hail to yourself! oh cock," said the White Pet. 
 "Where," said the cock," are you going?" 
 "I," said the White Pet, "am going away, for they were threatening my
death at Christmas." 
 "They were going to kill me at the very same time," said the cock, "
and I will go with you." 
 "Come, then," said the White Pet. 
 They went forward until they fell in with a goose. "All hail! White
Pet," said the goose. "All hail to yourself! oh goose," said the White
Pet. 
 "Where are you going?" said the goose. 
 "I," said the White Pet, "am running away, because they were going to
kill me at Christmas." 
 "They were going to do that to me too," said the goose, "and I will go
with you." 
 The party went forward until the night was drawing on them, and they
saw a little light far away; and though far off, they were not long
getting there. When they reached the house they said to each other that
they would look in at the window to see who was in the house, and they saw
thieves counting money; and the White Pet said, "Let every one of us call
his own call. I will call my own call; and let the bull call his own call;
let the dog call his own call; and the cat her own call; and the cock his
own call; and the goose his own call." With that they gave out one shout
-- Gaire! 
 When the thieves heard the shouting outside, they thought the mischief
was there; and they fled out, and they went to a wood that was near them.
When the White Pet and his company saw that the house was empty, they went
in and they got the money that the thieves had been counting, and they
divided it among themselves; and then they thought that they would settle
to rest. Said the White Pet, "Where will you sleep tonight, oh bull?" 
 "I will sleep," said the bull, "behind the door where I used to
be." 
 "Where will you sleep, White Pet?" 
 "I will sleep," said the White Pet, "in the middle of the floor where I
used to be." 
 "Where will you sleep, oh dog?" said the White Pet. 
 "I will sleep beside the fire where I used to be," said the dog. 
 "Where will you sleep, oh cat?" 
 "I will sleep," said the cat, "in the candle press, where I like to
be." 
 "Where will you sleep, oh cock?" said the White Pet. 
 "I," said the cock, " will sleep on the rafters where I used to
be." 
 "Where will you sleep, oh goose?" 
 "I will sleep," said the goose, "on the manure pile, where I was
accustomed to be." 
 They were not long settled to rest, when one of the thieves returned to
look in to see if he could perceive if any one at all was in the house.
All things were still, and he went on forward to the candle press for a
candle, that he might kindle to make him a light; but when he put his hand
in the box the cat thrust her claws into his hand, but he took a candle
with him, and he tried to light it. Then the dog got up, and he stuck his
tail into a pot of water that was beside the fire; he shook his tail and
put out the candle. Then the thief thought that the mischief was in the
house, and he fled; but when he was passing the White Pet, he gave him a
blow; before he got past the bull, he gave him a kick; and the cock began
to crow; and when he went out, the goose began to belabor him with his
wings about the shanks. 
 He went to the wood where his comrades were, as fast as was in his
legs. They asked him how it had gone with him. "It went," said he, "but
middling; when I went to the candle press, there was a man in it who
thrust ten knives into my hand; and when I went to the fireside to light
the candle, there was a big black man lying there, who was sprinkling
water on it to put it out; and when I tried to go out, there was a big man
in the middle of the floor, who gave me a shove; and another man behind
the door who pushed me out; and there was a little brat on the loft
calling out Cuir-anees-an-shaw-ay-s-foni-mi-hayn-da -- Send him up here
and I'll do for him; and there was a shoemaker, out on the manure pile,
belaboring me about the shanks with his apron." 
 When the thieves heard that, they did not return to seek their lot of
money; and the White Pet and his comrades got it to themselves; and it
kept them peaceably as long as they lived.
