A poore man travelling from door to door a begging, being lately come from  Paris,  a City in  France,  being invited by hunger to a good simple Country Swain's doore, to aske his almes; his wife asked him what he was, and from whence he came?  
Quoth the fellow, from  Paris.   
From  Paradise  (quoth she) then thou knowest my old  John  there (meaning her former husband)  
I, quoth the fellow, that I doe.  
I pray thee (quoth she) how doth he doe?  
Faith (quoth the fellow) poore, he hath meat and drinke enough, but wants cloathes and mony.  
Alas, quoth she, I am sory for it, I pray thee stay a little; and, running up into her Chamber, fetcht downe her husbands new sute of cloathes, and five shillings in mony, and gave it to the fellow, saying, I pray thee remember me to my poore  John,  and give him this sute of clothes, and five shillings from me, and wrapt them up in a Fardle [a bundle], which the fellow took, and away he went.  
Presently her husband came home, and found her very pleasant and merry, singing up and downe the house, which she seldome used to doe, and he asked her the cause.  
Oh, husband, quoth she, I have heard from my old  John to-day,  he is in Paradise, and is very well, but wants clothes and mony, but I have sent him thy best sute, and five shillings in mony.  
Her husband seeing she was cozened, enquired of her which way the fellow went that had them.  
Yonder way, quoth she.  
He presently took his best horse, Hob, and rode after him for the clothes.  
The fellow seeing one ride so fast after him, threw the clothes into a ditch, and went softly forward.  
Her husband overtaking the fellow, said, Didst not see one go this way with a little fardle of clothes at his back?  
Yes, quoth the fellow, he is newly gone into yonder little Wood.  
Oh, hold my horse, quoth he, whilst I runne in and finde him out.  
I will, quoth the fellow, who presently, as soon as he was gone into the wood, took up his fardell, leapt on horseback, and away he went.  
The Man returning for his horse, his horse was gone; then going home to his wife, she asked him if he overtook the fellow.  
I, sweet heart, quoth he, and I have lent him my best horse to ride on, for it is a great long way to Paradise.  
Truly, husband, quoth she, and I shall love thee the better so long as I live, for making so much of my old  John.   
Which caused much good laughter to all that heard it.
