About sixty years ago in Alt-Marrin there lived a man by the name of 
Gust K. He too possessed a wolf strap, with which he brought about much 
damage and misery. Finally the strap was taken from him, and it was to be 
burned. Three times the baking oven was heated up, and three times the 
strap was thrown into the glowing fire, but each time it jumped back out 
of the flames.  
 Nor would water damage the strap. It always returned.  
 However, the pastor from Fritzow finally burned it up. When Gust K. 
died, the pastor at Alt-Marrin could not finish the Lord's Prayer, and 
they called on the pastor from Fritzow. The latter said, "Away, away with 
it!"  
 When they tried to lower him into the earth, the grave opening was too 
small, so the pallbearers had to trample him down with their feet. For a 
long time afterward there was always a hole in his grave mound, but it 
will have closed up by now, for grass has been growing over the story of 
Gust K. for a long time now.
