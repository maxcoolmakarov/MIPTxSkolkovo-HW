There was once upon a time a man and woman who had three fine-looking 
sons, but they were so poor that they had hardly enough food for 
themselves, let alone their children. So the sons determined to set out 
into the world and to try their luck. Before starting their mother gave 
them each a loaf of bread and her blessing, and having taken a tender 
farewell of her and their father the three set forth on their travels.   
The youngest of the three brothers, whose name was Ferko, was a beautiful 
youth, with a splendid figure, blue eyes, fair hair, and a complexion like 
milk and roses. His two brothers were as jealous of him as they could be, 
for they thought that with his good looks he would be sure to be more 
fortunate than they would ever be.   
One day all the three were sitting resting under a tree, for the sun was 
hot and they were tired of walking. Ferko fell fast asleep, but the other 
two remained awake, and the eldest said to the second brother, "What do 
you say to doing our brother Ferko some harm? He is so beautiful that 
everyone takes a fancy to him, which is more than they do to us. If we 
could only get him out of the way we might succeed better."   
"I quite agree with you," answered the second brother, "and my advice is 
to eat up his loaf of bread, and then to refuse to give him a bit of ours 
until he has promised to let us put out his eyes or break his legs."   
His eldest brother was delighted with this proposal, and the two wicked 
wretches seized Ferko's loaf and ate it all up, while the poor boy was 
still asleep.   
When he did awake he felt very hungry and turned to eat his bread, but his 
brothers cried out, "You ate your loaf in your sleep, you glutton, and you 
may starve as long as you like, but you won't get a scrap of ours."   
Ferko was at a loss to understand how he could have eaten in his sleep, 
but he said nothing, and fasted all that day and the next night. But on 
the following morning he was so hungry that he burst into tears, and 
implored his brothers to give him a little bit of their bread. Then the 
cruel creatures laughed, and repeated what they had said the day before; 
but when Ferko continued to beg and beseech them, the eldest said at last, 
"If you will let us put out one of your eyes and break one of your legs, 
then we will give you a bit of our bread."   
At these words poor Ferko wept more bitterly than before, and bore the 
torments of hunger till the sun was high in the heavens; then he could 
stand it no longer, and he consented to allow his left eye to be put out 
and his left leg to be broken. When this was done he stretched out his 
hand eagerly for the piece of bread, but his brothers gave him such a tiny 
scrap that the starving youth finished it in a moment and besought them 
for a second bit.   
But the more Ferko wept and told his brothers that he was dying of hunger, 
the more they laughed and scolded him for his greed. So he endured the 
pangs of starvation all that day, but when night came his endurance gave 
way, and he let his right eye be put out and his right leg broken for a 
second piece of bread.   
After his brothers had thus successfully maimed and disfigured him for 
life, they left him groaning on the ground and continued their journey 
without him.   
Poor Ferko ate up the scrap of bread they had left him and wept bitterly, 
but no one heard him or came to his help. Night came on, and the poor 
blind youth had no eyes to close, and could only crawl along the ground, 
not knowing in the least where he was going. But when the sun was once 
more high in the heavens, Ferko felt the blazing heat scorch him, and 
sought for some cool shady place to rest his aching limbs. He climbed to 
the top of a hill and lay down in the grass, and as he thought under the 
shadow of a big tree. But it was no tree he leant against, but a gallows 
on which two ravens were seated. The one was saying to the other as the 
weary youth lay down, "Is there anything the least wonderful or remarkable 
about this neighborhood?"   
"I should just think there was," replied the other; "many things that 
don't exist anywhere else in the world. There is a lake down there below 
us, and anyone who bathes in it, though he were at death's door, becomes 
sound and well on the spot, and those who wash their eyes with the dew on 
this hill become as sharp-sighted as the eagle, even if they have been 
blind from their youth."   
"Well," answered the first raven, "my eyes are in no want of this healing 
bath, for, Heaven be praised, they are as good as ever they were; but my 
wing has been very feeble and weak ever since it was shot by an arrow many 
years ago, so let us fly at once to the lake that I may be restored to 
health and strength again." And so they flew away.   
Their words rejoiced Ferko's heart, and he waited impatiently till evening 
should come and he could rub the precious dew on his sightless eyes.   
At last it began to grow dusk, and the sun sank behind the mountains; 
gradually it became cooler on the hill, and the grass grew wet with dew. 
Then Ferko buried his face in the ground till his eyes were damp with 
dewdrops, and in a moment he saw clearer than he had ever done in his life 
before. The moon was shining brightly, and lighted him to the lake where 
he could bathe his poor broken legs.   
Then Ferko crawled to the edge of the lake and dipped his limbs in the 
water. No sooner had he done so than his legs felt as sound and strong as 
they had been before, and Ferko thanked the kind fate that had led him to 
the hill where he had overheard the ravens' conversation. He filled a 
bottle with the healing water, and then continued his journey in the best 
of spirits.   
He had not gone far before he met a wolf, who was limping disconsolately 
along on three legs, and who on perceiving Ferko began to howl dismally. 
  
"My good friend," said the youth, "be of good cheer, for I can soon heal 
your leg," and with these words he poured some of the precious water over 
the wolf's paw, and in a minute the animal was springing about sound and 
well on all fours. The grateful creature thanked his benefactor warmly, 
and promised Ferko to do him a good turn if he should ever need it.   
Ferko continued his way till he came to a ploughed field. Here he noticed 
a little mouse creeping wearily along on its hind paws, for its front paws 
had both been broken in a trap.   
Ferko felt so sorry for the little beast that he spoke to it in the most 
friendly manner, and washed its small paws with the healing water. In a 
moment the mouse was sound and whole, and after thanking the kind 
physician it scampered away over the ploughed furrows.   
Ferko again proceeded on his journey, but he hadn't gone far before a 
queen bee flew against him, trailing one wing behind her, which had been 
cruelly torn in two by a big bird. Ferko was no less willing to help her 
than he had been to help the wolf and the mouse, so he poured some healing 
drops over the wounded wing. On the spot the queen bee was cured, and 
turning to Ferko she said, "I am most grateful for your kindness, and 
shall reward you some day." And with these words she flew away humming, 
gaily.   
Then Ferko wandered on for many a long day, and at length reached a 
strange kingdom. Here, he thought to himself, he might as well go straight 
to the palace and offer his services to the king of the country, for he 
had heard that the king's daughter was as beautiful as the day.   
So he went to the royal palace, and as he entered the door the first 
people he saw were his two brothers who had so shamefully ill-treated him. 
They had managed to obtain places in the king's service, and when they 
recognized Ferko with his eyes and legs sound and well they were 
frightened to death, for they feared he would tell the king of their 
conduct, and that they would be hung.   
No sooner had Ferko entered the palace than all eyes were turned on the 
handsome youth, and the king's daughter herself was lost in admiration, 
for she had never seen anyone so handsome in her life before. His brothers 
noticed this, and envy and jealousy were added to their fear, so much so 
that they determined once more to destroy him. They went to the king and 
told him that Ferko was a wicked magician, who had come to the palace with 
the intention of carrying off the princess.   
Then the king had Ferko brought before him, and said, "You are accused of 
being a magician who wishes to rob me of my daughter, and I condemn you to 
death; but if you can fulfill three tasks which I shall set you to do your 
life shall be spared, on condition you leave the country; but if you 
cannot perform what I demand you shall be hung on the nearest tree."   
And turning to the two wicked brothers he said, "Suggest something for him 
to do; no matter how difficult, he must succeed in it or die."   
They did not think long, but replied, "Let him build your Majesty in one 
day a more beautiful palace than this, and if he fails in the attempt let 
him be hung."   
The king was pleased with this proposal, and commanded Ferko to set to 
work on the following day. The two brothers were delighted, for they 
thought they had now got rid of Ferko forever. The poor youth himself was 
heart-broken, and cursed the hour he had crossed the boundary of the 
king's domain. As he was wandering disconsolately about the meadows round 
the palace, wondering how he could escape being put to death, a little bee 
flew past, and settling on his shoulder whispered in his ear, "What is 
troubling you, my kind benefactor? Can I be of any help to you? I am the 
bee whose wing you healed, and would like to show my gratitude in some 
way."   
Ferko recognized the queen bee, and said, "Alas! how could you help me? 
for I have been set to do a task which no one in the whole world could do, 
let him be ever such a genius! Tomorrow I must build a palace more 
beautiful than the king's, and it must be finished before evening."   
"Is that all?" answered the bee, "then you may comfort yourself; for 
before the sun goes down tomorrow night a palace shall be built unlike any 
that king has dwelt in before. Just stay here till I come again and tell 
you that it is finished." Having said this she flew merrily away, and 
Ferko, reassured by her words, lay down on the grass and slept peacefully 
till the next morning.   
Early on the following day the whole town was on its feet, and everyone 
wondered how and where the stranger would build the wonderful palace. The 
princess alone was silent and sorrowful, and had cried all night till her 
pillow was wet, so much did she take the fate of the beautiful youth to 
heart.   
Ferko spent the whole day in the meadows waiting the return of the bee. 
And when evening was come the queen bee flew by, and perching on his 
shoulder she said, "The wonderful palace is ready. Be of good cheer, and 
lead the king to the hill just outside the city walls." And humming gaily 
she flew away again.   
Ferko went at once to the king and told him the palace was finished. The 
whole court went out to see the wonder, and their astonishment was great 
at the sight which met their eyes. A splendid palace reared itself on the 
hill just outside the walls of the city, made of the most exquisite 
flowers that ever grew in mortal garden. The roof was all of crimson 
roses, the windows of lilies, the walls of white carnations, the floors of 
glowing auriculas and violets, the doors of gorgeous tulips and narcissi 
with sunflowers for knockers, and all round hyacinths and other 
sweet-smelling flowers bloomed in masses, so that the air was perfumed far 
and near and enchanted all who were present.   
This splendid palace had been built by the grateful queen bee, who had 
summoned all the other bees in the kingdom to help her.   
The king's amazement knew no bounds, and the princess's eyes beamed with 
delight as she turned them from the wonderful building on the delighted 
Ferko. But the two brothers had grown quite green with envy, and only 
declared the more that Ferko was nothing but a wicked magician.   
The king, although he had been surprised and astonished at the way his 
commands had been carried out, was very vexed that the stranger should 
escape with his life, and turning to the two brothers he said, "He has 
certainly accomplished the first task, with the aid no doubt of his 
diabolical magic; but what shall we give him to do now? Let us make it as 
difficult as possible, and if he fails he shall die."   
Then the eldest brother replied, "The corn has all been cut, but it has 
not yet been put into barns; let the knave collect all the grain in the 
kingdom into one big heap before tomorrow night, and if as much as a stalk 
of corn is left let him be put to death."   
The princess grew white with terror when she heard these words; but Ferko 
felt much more cheerful than he had done the first time, and wandered out 
into the meadows again, wondering how he was to get out of the difficulty. 
But he could think of no way of escape. The sun sank to rest and night 
came on, when a little mouse started out of the grass at Ferko's feet, and 
said to him, "I'm delighted to see you, my kind benefactor; but why are 
you looking so sad? Can I be of any help to you, and thus repay your great 
kindness to me?"   
Then Ferko recognized the mouse whose front paws he had healed, and 
replied, "Alas I how can you help me in a matter that is beyond any human 
power! Before tomorrow night all the grain in the kingdom has to be 
gathered into one big heap, and if as much as a stalk of corn is wanting I 
must pay for it with my life."   
"Is that all?" answered the mouse; "that needn't distress you much. Just 
trust in me, and before the sun sets again you shall hear that your task 
is done." And with these words the little creature scampered away into the 
fields.   
Ferko, who never doubted that the mouse would be as good as its word, lay 
down comforted on the soft grass and slept soundly till next morning. The 
day passed slowly, and with the evening came the little mouse and said, 
"Now there is not a single stalk of corn left in any field; they are all 
collected in one big heap on the hill out there."   
Then Ferko went joyfully to the king and told him that all he demanded had 
been done. And the whole Court went out to see the wonder, and were no 
less astonished than they had been the first time. For in a heap higher 
than the king's palace lay all the grain of the country, and not a single 
stalk of corn had been left behind in any of the fields. And how had all 
this been done? The little mouse had summoned every other mouse in the 
land to its help, and together they had collected all the grain in the 
kingdom.   
The king could not hide his amazement, but at the same time his wrath 
increased, and he was more ready than ever to believe the two brothers, 
who kept on repeating that Ferko was nothing more nor less than a wicked 
magician. Only the beautiful princess rejoiced over Ferko's success, and 
looked on him with friendly glances, which the youth returned.   
The more the cruel king gazed on the wonder before him, the more angry he 
became, for he could not, in the face of his promise, put the stranger to 
death. He turned once more to the two brothers and said, "His diabolical 
magic has helped him again, but now what third task shall we set him to 
do? No matter how impossible it is, he must do it or die."   
The eldest answered quickly, "Let him drive all the wolves of the kingdom 
on to this hill before tomorrow night. If he does this he may go free; if 
not he shall be hung as you have said."   
At these words the princess burst into tears, and when the king saw this 
he ordered her to be shut up in a high tower and carefully guarded till 
the dangerous magician should either have left the kingdom or been hung on 
the nearest tree.   
Ferko wandered out into the fields again, and sat down on the stump of a 
tree wondering what he should do next. Suddenly a big wolf ran up to him, 
and standing still said, "I'm very glad to see you again, my kind 
benefactor. What are you thinking about all alone by yourself? If I can 
help you in any way only say the word, for I would like to give you a 
proof of my gratitude."   
Ferko at once recognized the wolf whose broken leg he had healed, and told 
him what he had to do the following day if he wished to escape with his 
life. "But how in the world," he added, "am I to collect all the wolves of 
the kingdom on to that hill over there?"   
"If that's all you want done," answered the wolf, "you needn't worry 
yourself. I'll undertake the task, and you'll hear from me again before 
sunset tomorrow. Keep your spirits up." And with these words he trotted 
quickly away.   
Then the youth rejoiced greatly, for now he felt that his life was safe; 
but he grew very sad when he thought of the beautiful princess, and that 
he would never see her again if he left the country. He lay down once more 
on the grass and soon fell fast asleep.   
All the next day he spent wandering about the fields, and toward evening 
the wolf came running to him in a great hurry and said, "I have collected 
together all the wolves in the kingdom, and they are waiting for you in 
the wood. Go quickly to the king, and tell him to go to the hill that he 
may see the wonder you have done with his own eyes. Then return at once to 
me and get on my back, and I will help you to drive all the wolves 
together."   
Then Ferko went straight to the palace and told the king that he was ready 
to perform the third task if he would come to the hill and see it done. 
Ferko himself returned to the fields, and mounting on the wolf's back he 
rode to the wood close by.   
Quick as lightning the wolf flew round the wood, and in a minute many 
hundred wolves rose up before him, increasing in number every moment, till 
they could be counted by thousands. He drove them all before him on to the 
hill, where the king and his whole Court and Ferko's two brothers were 
standing. Only the lovely princess was not present, for she was shut up in 
her tower weeping bitterly.   
The wicked brothers stamped and foamed with rage when they saw the failure 
of their wicked designs. But the king was overcome by a sudden terror when 
he saw the enormous pack of wolves approaching nearer and nearer, and 
calling out to Ferko he said, "Enough, enough, we don't want any more." 
  
But the wolf on whose back Ferko sat, said to its rider, "Go on! go on!" 
and at the same moment many more wolves ran up the hill, howling horribly 
and showing their white teeth.   
The king in his terror called out, "Stop a moment; I will give you half my 
kingdom if you will drive all the wolves away." But Ferko pretended not to 
hear, and drove some more thousands before him, so that everyone quaked 
with horror and fear.   
Then the king raised his voice again and called out, "Stop! you shall have 
my whole kingdom, if you will only drive these wolves back to the places 
they came from."   
But the wolf kept on encouraging Ferko, and said, "Go on! go on!" So he 
led the wolves on, till at last they fell on the king and on the wicked 
brothers, and ate them and the whole Court up in a moment.   
Then Ferko went straight to the palace and set the princess free, and on 
the same day he married her and was crowned king of the country. And the 
wolves all went peacefully back to their own homes, and Ferko and his 
bride lived for many years in peace and happiness together, and were much 
beloved by great and small in the land.
