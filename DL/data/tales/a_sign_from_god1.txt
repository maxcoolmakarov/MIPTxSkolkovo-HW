In Magdeburg they formerly showed (I do not know if they still do) a house with
a plaque depicting a horse that was looking out the window of a house's
upper story. The following legend explains this plaque: 
 A man buried his wife with the pomp expected of his class, leaving on
her finger a valuable diamond ring. The greedy gravedigger noticed this,
and therefore returned that night to open the grave, pry up the coffin
lid, and attempt to remove the ring from the dead woman. However, the ring
was tight, and he had to push and twist and turn, which revived the woman,
who was only in a trance. She sat up, giving the disloyal gravedigger such
a fright that he fell down unconscious. 
 The woman, herself frightened by her helpless condition, picked up the
gravedigger's lantern and staggered toward her husband's house.  
 She knocked.  
 The servant asked, "Who is there?" 
 "It's me," she answered, "the lady of the house. Open the door for
me." 
 Deathly pale, he ran to his master's room and told him the news. 
 "My wife will never return from her grave," he answered, "any more than
would my horses walk up the steps in order to look out the window." 
 Then he heard clip clop up the steps. It was his horses. Then the man
believed, went downstairs, opened the door, and received his wife, who he
thought was dead. And he lived happily with her for many long years.
