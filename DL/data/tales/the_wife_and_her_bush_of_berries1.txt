Lang syne, when geese were swine,  
And turkeys chewed tobacco,  
And birds biggit their nests in auld mens's beards,   
And mowdies del't potawtoes --  
  
There was a wife that lived 'n a wee house by hersel', and as she was soopin' the house one day, she fand twall pennies. So she thought to hersel' what she wad do wi' her twall pennies, and at last she thought she couldna do better than gang wi't to the market and buy a kid. Sae she gaed to the market and coffed a fine kid. And as she was gaun hame, she spied a bonny buss o' bernies growin' beside a brig. And she says to the kid, "Kid, kid, keep my house till I pu' my bonny, bonny buss o' berries."   
"'Deed no," says the kid, "I'll no keep your house till ye pu' your bonny buss o' berries."   
Then the wife gaed to the dog, and said, "Dog, dog, bite kid. Kid winna keep my house till I pu' my bonny buss o' berries."   
"'Deed," says the dog, "I'll no bite the kid, for the kid never did me ony ill."   
Then the wife gaed to a staff and said, "Staff, staff, strike dog; for dog winna bite kid, and kid winna keep my house," etc.   
"'Deed," says the staff, "I winna strike the dog, for the dog never did me ony ill."   
Then the wife gaed to the fire, and said, "Fire, fire, burn staff. Staff winna strike dog; dog winna bite kid," etc.
