I'm none of those who coldly say,    
"'Tis nothing -- 'tis a woman drowned;"    
I say 'tis much, and merits grief profound,    
When one of these is lost who make life gay.   
Quite a propos is what I've here to tell,    
A tale of one who in the river fell,    
And made her melancholy exit there.    
Her husband for the body looked with care;    
He thought a handsome funeral her due.    
It chanced, as near the fatal spot he drew,    
He met some strollers by the riverside,    
Who nothing of the matter knew.    
"Have any of ye seen my wife?" he cried.    
"No, not a trace of her," said one; "but go,    
Run with the current, look for her below."    
"Rather run up," another cried, "good man,    
As her opposing spirit doubtless ran:    
All things float down the current, it is true,    
But she'll float up, be sure, to bother you!"    
He joked, I think, a little out of season.    
This female character of contradiction    
Is true perhaps, perhaps is fiction;    
I'll not attempt about it here to reason:    
But she that got it with her early breath.    
Will keep it even when in death;    
Her contradiction to the end will go,    
Ay, and beyond it too, for all I know.
