There was a man once in the Isle of Man who met one of the Little Fellows, 
and the Little Fellow told him that if he would go to London Bridge and 
dig, he would find a fortune. So he went, and when he got there he began 
to dig, and another man came to him and said, "What are you doing?"   
"One of Themselves told me to come to London Bridge and I would get a 
fortune," says he.   
And the other man said, "I dreamed that I was back in the lil' islan' an' 
I was at a house with a thorn tree at the chimley of it, and if I would 
dig there I would find a fortune. But I wouldn' go, for it was only 
foolishness."   
Then he told him so plainly about the house that the first man knew it was 
his own, so he went back to the Island. When he got home he dug under the 
little thorn tree by the chimney and he found an iron box. He opened the 
box, and it was full of gold, and there was a letter in it, but he could 
not read the letter because it was in a foreign language. So he put it in 
the smithy window and challenged any scholar who went by to read it. None 
of them could, but at last one big boy said it was Latin and it meant, 
"Dig again and you'll find another."   
So the man dug again under the thorn tree, and what did he find but 
another iron box full of gold! And from that day till the day of his 
death, that man used to open the front door before going to bed, and call 
out, "My blessing with the Little Fellows!"
