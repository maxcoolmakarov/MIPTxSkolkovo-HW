Late one evening a man was walking across a field, returning to Gandshoven from Molenbeek. Suddenly three will-o'-the-wisps came running toward him. Because this good man was accustomed to baptizing such, in order to redeem all three, he said, "I baptize you all in the name of the father and the son and the holy ghost."   
But then it did not go well for him, for in the same instant he saw that he was surrounded by more than a thousand will-o'-the-wisps, all wanting to be baptized. He baptized unceasingly, but ever more of them approached him, and this did not end until the cock crowed. Thus the man had to spend the entire night in the field.
