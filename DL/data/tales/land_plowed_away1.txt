In Klein-Paaren there was once a peasant who, during his lifetime,
plowed away the edges of his neighbors' fields, then afterwards moved the
boundary stones.  Heaven punished him for this.  He had scarcely died
before he began appearing in the night at the place where he had sinned.
He was seen there busily digging at the land he had plowed away.  He was
also often seen panting and carrying a heavy boundary stone about.  He
would call out in misery, "Where shall I set it down?  Where shall I set
it down?" 
 This was often heard at midnight until finally the preacher went out to
that place and said, "In God's name, set it back down where you found it." 
 He did that, and since then he has not been seen again.  It may be that
he has found redemption.
