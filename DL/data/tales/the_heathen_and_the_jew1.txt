Once a heathen and a Jew were walking along together, when the heathen 
remarked to the Jew, "My religion is better than yours."   
"Not so," replied the Jew; "on the contrary, mine is better than yours, as 
it is said:  What nation is there so great that has statutes and 
judgments so righteous as all this law. "   
The heathen then said, "Supposing it is decided my religion is better than 
yours, then I will take your money; but if it be decided that your 
religion is better than mine, then you shall take my money."   
The Jew replied, "I agree to accept this condition."   
As they were walking along, Satan appeared to them in the form of an old 
man. They thereupon asked him the question as to whose religion was the 
better; and he replied, "That of the heathen is the better."   
After they had proceeded a little farther, Satan appeared to them again, 
in the form of a young man. They put the same question, and they received 
the same reply. When they had walked a little farther, he appeared to them 
again in the form of another old man. On asking the same question again, 
the identical reply was once more given. The heathen therefore took the 
Israelite's money.   
The Israelite then journeyed on in fear of his life, and lodged in the 
open. When a third of the night had gone by, he heard some spirits 
speaking to each other. Two of them asked a third, "Where have you been 
today?" to which he replied, "I met a Jew and an Aramean, I laughed at 
them and gave evidence in favor of the heathen."   
Then they asked another, "Where have you been today?" to which he replied, 
"I prevented the daughter of an emperor from giving birth, after she had 
suffered the pains of travail for seven days. But if they had taken some 
green leaves of the tree overhanging their throne, and had squeezed them 
upon her nose, she would have given birth immediately."   
They again addressed a third spirit, "Where have you been?"   
He replied, "I stopped up the well of a certain province. But if they had 
taken a black ox and had slaughtered it over the water, the well would 
have been open again."   
The Jew gave great heed to their conversation; and, rising up early in the 
morning, he went to the country of the emperor spoken of, and found his 
daughter in travail. He then told one to take some green leaves of the 
tree overhanging their throne, and to squeeze them upon her nose. This was 
done, and she immediately gave birth. The king thereupon presented the Jew 
with a large sum of money, because this was the only child he had.   
The Jew then journeyed to the country in which the stopped wells were to 
be found, and told the people to take a black ox and slaughter it over the 
well, after which the water would flow as usual. They did so, and the 
water flowed. The inhabitants thereupon presented him with a large sum of 
money.   
On the morrow he met the heathen who had taken his money, and the heathen 
expressed his surprise by saying, "Have I not already taken all your money 
from you; how is it that you are such a rich man?" He then related to him 
what had happened.   
"Then I will also go," he said, "and inquire of the people of that place." 
He therefore journeyed on and lodged in that field; but the three spirits 
came and killed him, for it is said:  The righteous is delivered out of 
trouble, and the wicked cometh in his stead  (Proverbs, 11:8).
