Once upon a time a monkey noticed some wheat which had fallen into a 
small hollow in a rock. Thrusting in his hand, he filled it with the 
grain, but the entrance was so narrow that he was unable to draw it out 
without relinquishing most of his prize. This, however, he was unwilling 
to do, greedily desiring to have it all. So the consequence was that he 
remained without any, and finally went hungry away.
