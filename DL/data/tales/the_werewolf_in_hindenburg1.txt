One still believes in werewolves in the Altmark.  Even today in the
village of
Hindenburg they tell about a man who could turn himself into a wolf, and
there
are people still alive who knew him during their childhood. 
He had a strip of leather made from wolf skin which still had its hair. 
Whenever he tied it around his body, he turned into a wolf.  Then he had
such
extraordinary strength that he could pull an entire load of hay by himself
or
grab a whole ox in his mouth and carry it away. 
In this state he had the nature of a wolf.  He strangled cattle and even
ate
humans.  He once pursued one of his neighbors, who narrowly escaped from
him. 
But however furious he became, he did spare his wife.  She knew a magic
charm
that brought him under control, a charm that he himself had taught her.
Then
she would take off the leather strip, and he would become a reasonable
human
once again.
