The most important magic books are the sixth and seventh books of Moses. Because their contents bring misfortune, they were excluded from the Bible. However, they are still found now and again, pastors having kept them in their churches. If one throws such books into the fire, they will not burn.  
A journeyman miller owned such a magic book. Once when he had gone to church the master came by and read in the book, which he had left lying on the table. The master very much liked the stories he was reading, but while he was reading, numerous lords came in through the door, sat down at the table, and demanded work.  
This terrified the master, and he sent someone to the church to fetch the journeyman. The journeyman read everything backwards that the master had read forwards, and with that the spirits disappeared. Nevertheless, the journeyman was very angry at the master's audacity, scolded him, and told him never again to touch his books.
