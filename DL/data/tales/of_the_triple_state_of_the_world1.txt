A certain knight had three sons, and on his deathbed he bequeathed the
inheritance to his firstborn; to the second, his treasury; and to the
third, a very valuable ring, of more worth indeed than all he had left to
the others. 
 But the two former had also rings, and they were all apparently the
same. 
 After their father's death the first son said, "I possess that precious
ring of my father." 
 The second said, "You have it not -- I have." 
 To this the third son answered, "That is not true. The elder of us has
the estate, the second the treasure, and therefore it is but meet that I
should have the most valuable ring." 
 The first son answered, "Let us prove, then, whose claims to it have
the preeminence." 
 They agreed, and several sick men were made to resort to them for the
purpose. The two first rings had no effect, but the last cured all their
infirmities. 
 
 
 Application: 
 
 My beloved, the knight is Christ. The three sons are the Jews, Saracens
[Muslims], and Christians. The most valuable ring is faith, which is the
property of the younger, that is, of the Christians
