In Livland there is the following legend:  When Christmas Day is over a
boy who
limps with one leg goes around calling together all those who have yielded
to
the Evil One -- and there is a large number of them -- bidding them to
follow
him.  If any one of these resists or hesitates, then a large tall man is
also
there who hits at them with a whip braided from iron wire and little
chains,
driving them along with force.  It is said that he whips at the people so
cruelly that a long time later marks and scars can still be seen on their
bodies, and they are in great pain. 
As soon as they begin to follow him, it appears as though they lose their
former
shape and turn into wolves.  Several thousand of them come together.
Their
leader, with the iron whip in his hand, leads the way.  When they have
been led
into a field, they cruelly attack the cattle, ripping every animal to
pieces
that they can catch, thus doing great damage.  However, they are not able
to
harm humans. 
When they come to a body of water, their leader strikes at it with his
switch or
whip, and it divides, allowing them to cross over with dry feet.  After
twelve
days have passed, they abandon their werewolf form and become humans once
again.
