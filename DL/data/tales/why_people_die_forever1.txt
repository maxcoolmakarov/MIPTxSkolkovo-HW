One time Old Man said to Old Woman, "People will never die."  
 Oh! " said Old Woman, "that will never do; because, if people live 
always, there will be too many people in the world."  
 "Well," said, Old Man, "we do not want to die forever. We shall die for 
four days and then come to life again."  
 "Oh, no!" said Old Woman, "it will be better to die forever, so that we 
shall be sorry for each other."  
 "Well," said Old Man, "we will decide this way. We will throw a buffalo 
chip into the water. If it sinks, we will die forever; if it floats, we 
shall live again."  
 "Well," said Old Woman, "throw it in."  
 Now, Old Woman had great power, and she caused the chip to turn into a 
stone, so it sank. So when we die, we die forever.
