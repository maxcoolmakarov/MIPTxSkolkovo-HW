A journeyman cooper found work with an old female master in Binsachsen.
Once when he was going out for the evening, the woman asked him if he was
not afraid to come home by himself. "No," he said. His way home led him
across a meadow, where a large cat approached him and ran along beside
him. He took no further notice of it.
 The next evening he went out again, and his landlady once again asked
him if he was not afraid. He told her about the cat, but said that he had
no fear of such a dumb animal. This time when he came to the meadow the
cat was there again, but now it ran toward him and was about to jump on
him. He hit it with a pair of pincers, breaking its left front leg, and it
fled screaming.
 The next morning the master did not get out of bed. The journeyman
pulled back her covers and saw that her left arm was broken. Thus it was
disclosed that the woman was a witch.
