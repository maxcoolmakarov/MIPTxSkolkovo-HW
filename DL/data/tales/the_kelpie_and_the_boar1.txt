A miller was annoyed by a kelpie entering his mill during night and playing havoc among the grain and meal. One night he shut up in the mill his boar, for a miller generally kept a good many pigs and a breeding sow or two. As usual kelpie entered the mill. The boar stood on his defence, and fought the kelpie.   
Next night the creature appeared at the miller's window, and called to him, "Is there a chattie i' the mill the nicht?"   
"Aye, there is a chattie i' the mill, an will be for ever mair," was the answer.   
Kelpie returned no more to the mill.
