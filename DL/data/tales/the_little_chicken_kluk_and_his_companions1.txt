There was once a little chicken called Kluk. A nut fell on his back, and 
gave him such a blow that he fell down and rolled on the ground. So he ran 
to the hen, and said, "Henny Penny, run, I think all the world is 
falling!"   
"Who has told thee that, little chicken Kluk?"   
"Oh, a nut fell on my back, and struck me so that I rolled on the 
ground."  
"Then let us run," said the hen.   
So they ran to the cock, and said, " Cocky Locky, run, I think all the 
world is falling."   
"Who has told thee that, Henny Penny? "   
"Little chicken Kluk."   
"Who told thee that, little chicken Kluk?"   
"Oh, a nut fell on my back, and struck me so that I rolled on the ground." 
  
"Then let us run," said the cock. So they ran to the duck, and said, 
"Ducky Lucky, run, I think all the world is falling."   
"Who told thee that, Cocky Locky?"   
"Henny Penny."   
"Who has told thee that, Henny Penny?"   
"Little chicken Kluk."   
"Who has told thee that, little chicken Kluk?"   
"Oh, a nut fell on my back, and struck me so that I rolled on the ground." 
  
"Then let us run," said the duck. So they ran to the goose. "Goosy Poosy, 
run, I think all the world is falling."   
"Who has told thee that, Ducky Lucky?"   
"Cocky Locky."   
"Who has told thee that, Cocky Locky?"   
"Henny Penny."   
"Who has told thee that, Henny Penny ?"   
"Little chicken Kluk."   
"Who has told thee that, little chicken Kluk?"   
"Oh, a nut fell on my back, and struck me so, that I rolled on the ground. 
  
"Then let us run," said the goose. Then they ran to the fox, and said,  
Foxy Coxy, run, I think all the world is falling."   
"Who has told thee that, Goosy Poosy?"   
"Ducky Lucky."   
"Who has told thee that, Ducky Lucky?"   
"Cocky Locky."   
"Who has told thee that, Cocky Locky?"   
"Henny Penny."   
"Who has told thee that, Henny Penny?"   
"Little chicken Kluk."   
"Who has told thee that, little chicken Kluk?"   
"Oh, a nut fell on my back, and struck me so, that I rolled on the 
ground."   
"Then let us run," said the fox. So they all ran into the wood. Then the 
fox said, "I must now count and see if I have got you all here. I, Foxy 
Coxy, one; Goosy Poosy, two; Ducky Lucky, three; Cocky Locky, four; Henny 
Penny, five; and little chicken Kluk, six; Hei ! That one I'll snap up." 
  
He then said : "Let us run."   
So they ran further into the wood. Then said he,  Now I must count and see 
if I have got you all here. I, Foxy Coxy, one; Goosy Poosy, two; Ducky 
Lucky, three; Cocky Locky, four; Henny Penny, five; Hei! That one I'll 
snap up." And so he went on till he had eaten them all up.
