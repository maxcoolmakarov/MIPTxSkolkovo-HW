I have heard a story about an old woman in this town [Tavistock], who suspected she received assistance of the above [helpful] nature, and one evening coming suddenly into the room, she spied a ragged little creature, who jumped out at the door. She thought she would try still further to win the services of her elfin friend; and so bought some smart new clothes, as big as those made for a doll. These pretty things she placed by the side of her wheel.  
The pixy returned and put them on; when clapping her tiny hands in joy, she was heard to exclaim these lines (for pixies are so poetical, they always talk in rhyme):  
 
Pixy fine, pixy gay,  
Pixy now will run away. 
   
And off she went; but the ungrateful little creature never spun for the poor old woman after.
