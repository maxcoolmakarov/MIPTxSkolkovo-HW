Fairies were constantly seen on a fine evening by  Clwyda'r Banwan  (the Banwan Gates), dancing within the rings; but since the wonderful stone (on which was written fairy language in their characters, for nobody had ever understood them) had been removed from the center of the largest circle to Gnoll gardens, nobody had ever seen the fairies. But they had their revenge; for no sooner had the grotto, which cost Lady Mackworth thousands of pounds, been finished, than one evening -- oh! I shall never forget it! -- there was thunder and lightning and rain, such as was never seen or heard before; and next morning the grotto had disappeared, for the hill behind it fell over it, and has hidden it forever; and woe betide the man that will dare to clear away the earth. When the storm abated we all heard the fairies laughing heartily.
