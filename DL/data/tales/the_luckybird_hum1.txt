There was once a poor man, who used to earn a few  pánsas  
[copper coins] by cutting and selling wood. It was a hard struggle to 
support himself and wife and seven daughters. Never a bit of meat touched 
his lips, never a shoe covered his feet, and only a rag covered his back. 
 
 One day, when not feeling very well, he lay down under a tree to rest. 
The Lucky-Bird Humá happened to be flying about the place at the 
time, and, noticing the man's poverty and sickness, pitied him. So it flew 
down beside him and deposited a golden egg by his bundle of wood. In a 
little while the woodcutter awoke, and seeing the egg, picked it up and 
wrapped it in his cummerbund. He then took up his load and went to the 
 woni  [shopkeeper] who generally bought it. He sold him the egg for 
a trifle. He did not know what a wonderful egg it was, but the  woni  
knew, and asked him to go and get the bird that laid it, and he would give 
him a rupee as a gift.  
 The man promised, and on the following day went to the jungle as usual 
to prepare his load of wood. On the way back he sat down to rest under the 
tree where he had found the egg, and pretended to sleep. The bird 
Humá came again, and noticing that he was still as poor and as 
ill-looking as before, thought that he had not seen the egg, and therefore 
went and laid another close by him, in such a spot that he could not 
possibly miss seeing it; whereupon the woodcutter caught the bird, and 
rose up to carry it to the  woni .  
 "Oh! What are you going to do with me? Do not kill me. Do not imprison 
me, but set me free," cried the bird. "You shall not fail of a reward. 
Pluck one of my feathers and show it to the fire, and you shall at once 
arrive at my country, Koh-i-Qáf, where my parents will reward you. 
They will give you a necklace of pearls, the price of which no king on 
earth could give."  
 But the poor ignorant woodcutter would not listen to the bird's 
pleadings. His mind was too much occupied with the thought of the rupee 
that he felt certain of getting, and therefore he fastened the bird in his 
wrap, and ran off to the  woni  as fast as his load would permit. 
Alas, however, the bird died on the way from suffocation.  
 "What shall I do now?" thought the woodcutter. "The  woni  will 
not give me a rupee for a dead bird. Ha! Ha! I will show one its feathers 
to the fire. Perhaps the bird being dead will not make any difference." 
 
 Accordingly he did so, and immediately found himself on the 
Koh-i-Qáf, where he sought out the parents of the bird and told 
them all that had happened. Oh, how the parents and other birds wept when 
they saw the dead body of their beloved relative!  
 Attracted by the noise, a strange bird that happened to be passing at 
the time came in and inquired what was the matter. This bird carried a 
piece of grass in its beak, with which it could raise the dead.  
 "Why do you weep?" it said to the sorrowful company.  
 "Because our relative is dead. We shall never speak to it again," they 
replied.  
 "Weep not," said the strange bird. "Your relative shall live again." 
Whereupon it placed the piece of grass in the mouth of the corpse, and it 
revived.  
 When the bird Humá revived and saw the woodcutter, it severely 
upbraided him for his faithlessness and carelessness. "I could have made 
you great and happy," it said, "but now get you back to your burden of 
wood and humble home."  
 On this the poor man found himself back again in the jungle, and 
standing by the load of wood that he had prepared before he was 
transported to Koh-i-Qáf. He sold his wood, and then went home in a 
very sad frame of mind to his wife and daughters.  
 He never saw the bird Humá again.
