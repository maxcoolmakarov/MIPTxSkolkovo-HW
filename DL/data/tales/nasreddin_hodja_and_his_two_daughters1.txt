The Hodja had two daughters. Once they both came to visit him, and he 
asked them, "What are you living from?"   
The one said, "My husband is a farmer. He planted a lot of grain, so if it 
rains he will earn so much that he can buy me some new clothes."  
The other one said, "My husband is a potter. He has made a lot of pots, so 
if it does not rain, he will earn so much that he can buy me some new 
clothes."  
To this the Hodja said, "One of you will get what she wants; but I do not 
know which one it will be."
