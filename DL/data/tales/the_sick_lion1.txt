A lion had come to the end of his days and lay sick unto death at the 
mouth of his cave, gasping for breath. The 

animals, his subjects, came round him and drew nearer as he grew more and 
more helpless. When they saw him on the 

point of death they thought to themselves, "Now is the time to pay off old 
grudges." So the boar came up and drove at 

him with his tusks; then a bull gored him with his horns; still the lion 
lay helpless before them: so the ass, feeling 

quite safe from danger, came up, and turning his tail to the lion kicked 
up his heels into his face. "This is a double 

death," growled the lion.  
 Moral: Only cowards insult dying majesty.
