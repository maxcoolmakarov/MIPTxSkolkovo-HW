German Mythology   
 
 Placing a key next to an infant will prevent him from being exchanged.
 
 Women may never be left alone during the first six weeks following 
childbirth, for the devil then has more power over them.
 
 During the first six weeks following childbirth, mothers may not go 
to sleep until someone has come to watch the child.  If mothers are 
overcome by sleep, changelings are often laid in the cradle.  To prevent 
this one should lay a pair of men's pants over the cradle.
 
 Whenever the mother leaves the infant's room she should lay an 
article of the father's clothing on the child, so that it cannot be 
exchanged.
