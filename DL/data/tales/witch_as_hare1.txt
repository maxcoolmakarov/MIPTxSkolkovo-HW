On two days a hunter from Freiburg saw a hare in Schlossberg Forest and
shot at it. Both times it stood still, looked mockingly at the man, only
running away when the latter hurried toward it. The hunter presumed that
he was dealing with witchcraft, so he loaded his gun with consecrated
powder, then used this to shoot at the hare when he saw it a third time.
Instead of a hare, a female personage was there, standing on her head and
bleeding from a gunshot wound in her breast. When the hunter touched her,
she fell to the ground dead.
