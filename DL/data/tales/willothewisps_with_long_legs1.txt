A peasant from Hermsdorf was going home late one evening when he saw a will-o'-the-wisp. Being of a daring nature, he approached it. Without hesitating, the will-o'-the-wisp fled, and the peasant quickly followed after him. Thick on his heels, he saw that it had tremendously long legs, and that its head consisted of tips of glowing fire. However, it instantly disappeared, and the peasant was barely able to find his way home in the dark.
