Lüttensee 
 Legend Book of the Prussian State  
In the previous century in the vicinity of Lüttensee in Holstein 
there were two girls with enormously large heads who were descendants of 
the underground people who had exchanged them from the cradle for other 
children.  Previously, parents always kept a light burning near their 
children and kept constant watch to prevent the underground people from 
taking them away.  It is said that the girls lived in a house that was 
owned by a certain Eggert Möller, but no one knows what became of them.
