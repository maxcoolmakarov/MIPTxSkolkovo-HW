Three good comrades, a coal, a bladder, and a straw, had set forth 
together to another land. On their way they came to a horse's hoofprint 
filled with water, and they did not know how to get across this ocean. 
Finally they decided that the straw should lay himself across it, and the 
others would walk across the ocean on him.  
 The coal went first. When he got to the middle of the straw, he stopped 
to look around, thus burning through the straw, and they both drowned. 
 
 This seemed very funny to the bladder, and he began to laugh so hard 
that he burst.  
 A stone that saw everything said, "Yes, indeed, someone's misfortune, 
someone's ridicule!" 
 But in the end, those who ridicule also meet with misfortune 
themselves.
