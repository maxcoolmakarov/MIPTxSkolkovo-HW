Told by an old man in Steinfurt 
 In olden times many heathens lived around here, and it is still told
how they put to death old people who were over sixty years of age. They
would chop them into many small pieces, which were then put into large
jars. Then a little lamp was placed in each jar. They buried them in the
earth. To this day such jars are frequently dug up.
