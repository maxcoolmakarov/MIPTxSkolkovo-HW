A man and his son were once going with their donkey to market.  As they 
were walking along by his side a countryman passed them and said, "You 
fools, what is a donkey for but to ride upon?"  So the man put the boy on 
the donkey, and they went on their way.    
But soon they passed a group of men, one of whom said, "See that lazy 
youngster, he lets his father walk while he rides."   
So the man ordered 
his boy to get off, and got on himself.  
But they hadn't gone far when they passed two women, one of whom said to 
the other, "Shame on that lazy lout to let his poor little son trudge 
along."   
Well, the man didn't know what to do, but at last he took his boy 
up before him on the donkey.  
By this time they had come to the town, and the passersby began to jeer 
and point at them.  The man stopped and asked what they were scoffing at.   
  
The men said, "Aren't you ashamed of yourself for overloading that poor 
donkey of yours -- you and your hulking son?"    
The man and boy got off and 
tried to think what to do.  They thought and they thought, until at last 
they cut down a pole, tied the donkey's feet to it, and raised the pole 
and the donkey to their shoulders.  They went along amid the laughter of 
all who met them until they came to a bridge, when the donkey, getting 
one of his feet loose, kicked out and caused the boy to drop his end of 
the pole.  In the struggle the donkey fell over the bridge, and his 
forefeet being tied together, he was drowned.  
 
 Try to please everyone, and you will please no one.
