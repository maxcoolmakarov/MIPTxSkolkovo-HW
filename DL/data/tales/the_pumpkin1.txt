Ages ago when pumpkins were unkown here in this country, one day a peasant found a pumpkin on a hill not far from his village. He had no idea what he had found. Deeply concerned he asked the village judge what sort of thing it was, but the judge could not help him. He then approached the village elders hoping that one of them would be able to identify the mysterious object.  
They all stood there baffled, until finally one of them stepped forward and said, "It can only be a horse's egg, because you found it where the horses like to graze."  
The peasants all agreed with this explanation, but now there was a new difficulty: No one knew how to get a horse to sit on the egg to hatch it. Finally they decided that each house would assign a man to take turns hatching the egg.   
Because the pumpkin was already turning yellow they said, "The foal is almost ready to come out."  
The hatching turn came to an awkward fellow, and he turned this way and that way on the pumpkin causing it to lose its balance and roll into a gully where a hare was sleeping in the brush. The frightened hare ran away.  
The peasants pursued him, shouting, "Listen to us! Listen to us!"  
But the hare did not listen to them, but instead raced frantically into the woods.  
The peasants went back to the pumpkin to see how the hare had come out of it. They found a mass of pumpkin seeds. Now, first one and then another of them realized that was not an egg after all, but rather something entirely different.  
The judge distributed the seeds to the houses in the village with the instructions to plant them. The next summer they learned more about the mysterious thing, and since then they have planted pumpkins every year.  
The seed from which the first pumpkin grew must have been brought to our country by a bird from a foreign land, and thus the pumpkin grew on that hill not far from the village.
