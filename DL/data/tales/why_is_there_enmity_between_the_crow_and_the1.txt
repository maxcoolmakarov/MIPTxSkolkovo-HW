Hawk? 
 
 The crow was in very great distress, for however she tried and whatever
she did, she could not rear a family. No sooner were the young hatched,
than the hawk would come and pick them up. In vain did she try to hide her
nest in the hollows of a tree or in the thickets of a bush. As sure as
death would the hawk find them and eat them. 
 Not knowing what to do, she bethought herself and said, "How would it
do if I try and get the hawk to be godmother? For then, being a near
relation, she is sure to spare my little ones."  
 Said and done. She went out of her place to search for the hawk, and
finding her, she said, "Good morning, sister." 
 "Good morning," replied the hawk. 
 "How pleased I should feel," said the crow, "if you would become
godmother to my children." 
 "With pleasure," replied the hawk. "Why not?" And so they made up a
covenant of friendship and of good fellowship between them. 
 Before leaving the hawk, the crow said to her, "Now, sister, I have one
request to make." 
 "Granted," replied the hawk. "What is it?" 
 "I only beg of you to spare my children. Do not eat them when you have
found them." 
 "All right," replied the hawk. "I shall certainly not touch them. But
tell me how they look, so that in case I meet them, I may spare them." 
 "Oh," replied the crow, "mine are the most beautiful creatures in the
world. They are more lovely than any other bird can boast of." 
 "Very well. Rest assured. Go in peace." And they parted. 
 The crow, being quite satisfied with the hawk's promise, began flying
about the next day trying to find something with which to feed her
children. The hawk the next morning went about her own business and tried
to find some nice little young ones to eat. Flying about, she saw the
young ones of the thrush, the blackbird, and of other beautiful birds, and
she said to herself, "Surely these are the children of the crow. Look how
lovely and beautiful they are. I am not going to touch them." 
 She went all day without finding any little birds but these. And she
said to herself, "I must keep my word to my sister. I am not going to
touch them." And she went to bed hungry. The next day the same thing
happened, and still the hawk kept her word and would not touch them. 
 On the third day she was so hungry that she could scarcely  see out of
her eyes. Roaming about, the hawk suddenly lighted upon the nest of the
crow. Seeing the little, miserable, ugly things in the nest, the hawk at
first would not touch them, although she never dreamt that these ugly
things were the children of the crow, so much praised by her for their
beauty, and thought they must belong to some hideous bird. But what is one
to do when one is hungry? One eats what one gets, and not finding anything
better, she sat down and gobbled them up one by one, and then flew
away. 
 Not long after the hawk had left, the crow came in, feeling sure this
time to find her little ones unhurt. But how great was her dismay when she
found the nest empty! First she thought the little birds had tried their
wings and were flying about in the neighborhood, and she went in search of
them. Not finding them, she began to be a little more anxious, and hunting
a little more closely, found on the ground near some rushes some tufts of
feathers with little bones and blood. She knew at once that the hawk had
again been there, feeding on her children. 
 Full of wrath and fury, she went to find the hawk. Meeting her, she
said, "A nice sister and godmother you are! After you had promised most
faithfully not to touch my children, no sooner had I turned my back on
them, then you come again and eat them." 
 "I do not understand what you are saying," replied the hawk. "It is
your own fault. You told me your children were the most beautiful in the
world, and those which I have eaten were monsters of hideousness. If I had
not felt the pinch of hunger so strong, I would not have touched them, not
for anything, such ugly things they were! They nearly made me sick." 
 "Is that the way you keep your promise?" replied the angry crow. "After
having eaten them, you even have the impudence to tell lies and insult me.
Off with you! And woe betide you if I ever catch you, I will teach you to
behave properly." 
 From that day on, the hawk, if it gets near the crows, attacks them.
And from that day on there is implacable hatred between the crows and the
hawks.
