There was a man with his mother. The mother was much afraid of dying,
therefore she wished to go into a country where there is no death. The son
said, "Where is a country without death?" 
 She answered, "Well, there is such a country, bring me there!" The
woman was very old. 
 So they traveled into a very, very distant country to reach the country
where there is no death. They turned into a village and asked for water.
When it was given them, the son asked, "Is there death in this
country?" 
 The people answered, "Dear me, where do you come from that you ask such
a question concerning death?" 
 He answered, "My mother is afraid of dying, so she wants a country
where death is not." 
 The people said, "Why, go away!" 
 They went and turned to another village. There they asked again and
received the answer, "Why, what kind of man are you that you ask about
dying? Go away! There is death here." 
 Then they went to a very distant country and asked, "How is your
country? Is there death in it?" 
 The answer was, "No, people do not die here." 
 The mother was very glad, she said, "Well done, my son, you have
brought me to a country where there is no death." 
 Her son had a friend in that town, and to his home he brought his
mother. He said, "Here is my mother, let her live with you. I shall go to
our country, and after three years I shall return to see you and my
mother." His mother was satisfied. 
 So the boy returned to his native country and stayed there for some
time. 
 But his mother became sick; she got a headache; she said, "Friend of my
son, I have a headache." 
 On that the boy arose and called the people together. The people came
and sat down. The boy said, "I have called you because of the mother of my
friend, who is here. Now collect money, that we may give it to her son
when he returns. For she says her head is aching; and because of her
sickness her meat will spoil. For that reason," he said, "she must be
killed at once." 
 When the woman heard this, she began crying, "I am not sick! I have no
headache!" 
 But the people said, "Never mind, seize her, or her flesh will be
spoiled." So she was caught, brought, thrown on the ground and killed; her
flesh was divided among the people, and they ate it. The next day they
collected money and brought it to the friend of her son. 
 And her son came back. He sat down, they gave him food, and he ate. He
asked, "Where is my mother?" 
 His friend answered, "My friend, your mother was seized with sickness,
so we collected money, -- here is the money! -- and killed her, lest her
meat should be spoiled. For as for us, we do not die in our country; if a
man is seized with sickness, we kill him." 
 The boy replied, "Why, should I sell my mother? Never!" 
 Then he said, "I will but go." 
 His friend said, "You are angry?" 
 He replied, "No, I am not angry." 
 In the meantime the people came and wanted to eat the boy too. His
friend therefore went to him saying, "Go, or you also will be eaten like
your mother." He accompanied him into a distant country. 
 When the boy came home, he said to his people, "My mother has been
eaten by a lion." 
 That is all; and the people said, "Your mother was a sinful woman. Is
not death in all the world, and should there be a place where there is no
death?"
