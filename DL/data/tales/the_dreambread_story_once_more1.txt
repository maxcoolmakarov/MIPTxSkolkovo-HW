The following verses (to the tune of "Pop goes the Weasel") were communicated to me through the mediation of Mr. Max Deutch by Mr. Frank Wolff. They were composed by the latter in conjunction with an employee of the St. Louis Post Office. He is unable to identify any part as his contribution, and knows the tale merely as a floating anecdote. 
 
Two Irishmen and a Hebrew one day   
Went out for recreation.   
They took enough provisions along   
To spend a week's vacation.   
One night they got lost in the woods;   
The night was dark and lonely.   
At last the food they had gave out,   
Except a piece of baloney.   
As one of them took up a knife,   
I said, "It's no use of carving,   
For if we share this piece of baloney,   
It won't keep us from starving."   
So I suggested we all go to sleep,   
And so did Maloney.   
And the one that had the best of dreams   
Wins the piece of baloney.   
The following morn we all got up,   
It was quarter after seven.   
One of them said: "I had a dream,   
I died and went to heaven;   
St. Peter met me at the gate,   
Riding on a pony.   
I guess that dream couldn't be beat,   
So that wins the piece of baloney."   
The other one said: "I too had a dream;   
I died and went to heaven;   
St. Peter met me at the gate,   
Stuck out his hand, and said, 'Hello, Maloney!'   
I guess that dream couldn't be beat,   
So that wins the piece of baloney."   
The Hebrew said: "It's true, my friend,   
That you were sleeping.   
The reason why I know it is   
'Cause I was peeping.   
I saw you both go up in heaven;   
And, believe me, I was lonely;   
I thought you'd never come back again,   
So I got up and ate the baloney."
