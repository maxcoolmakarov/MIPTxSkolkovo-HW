It happened that a fisher, after fishing all day, caught only a little
fish. "Pray, let me go, master," said the fish. "I am much too small for
you to eat just now. If you put me back into the river I shall soon grow.
Then you can make a fine meal off me." 
 "Nay, nay, my little fish," said the fisher. "I have you now. I may not
catch you hereafter." 
 
 
 
 A little thing in hand is worth more than a great thing in
prospect.
