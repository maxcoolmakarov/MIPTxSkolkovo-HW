A hermit once took a young monk to the city. He had raised him since
childhood, and the old monk now wanted put the young one to a test.
Arriving in the city, they saw a number of women walking to and fro.
Filled with amazement, the young monk stared at them with calf's eyes.
Until now he had never seen a woman, for since his earliest childhood he
had been raised in a monastery. 
 He asked the old monk what these things were. 
 The old monk answered, saying, "They are geese." The women were wearing
white veils and white cloaks. 
 The young monk left good enough alone and said nothing more. Afterward,
when the two were back at their monastery, the young monk began to cry
bitterly. 
 The old monk asked him why he was crying. 
 The young monk replied, "Father, why should I not be crying! I wanted
every so badly to have a goose!"
