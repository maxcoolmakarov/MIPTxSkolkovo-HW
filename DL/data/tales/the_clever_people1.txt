One day a peasant took his good hazel stick out of the corner and said 
to his wife, "Trina, I am going across country, 
and shall not return for three days. If during that time the cattle dealer 
should happen to call and want to buy our three cows, 
you may strike a bargain at once, but not unless you can get two hundred 
talers for them, nothing less, do you hear." 
 "In God's name, just go in peace," answered the woman, "I will manage 
that." 
 "You, indeed," said the man. "You once fell on your head when you were 
a little child, and that affects you even now. 
But let me tell you this, if you do anything foolish, I will make your 
back black and blue, and not with paint, I assure you, but 
with the stick which I have in my hand. And the coloring shall last a 
whole year. You may rely on that." Having said that, the 
man went on his way. 
 The next morning the cattle dealer came, and the woman had no need to 
say many words to him. When he had seen the 
cows and heard the price, he said, "I am quite willing to give that. 
Honestly speaking, they are worth it. I will take the 
animals away with me at once."  
 He unfastened their chains and drove them out of the stall, but just as 
he was going out of the farmyard gate, the woman 
clutched him by the sleeve and said, "You must give me the two hundred 
talers now, or I cannot let the cows go." 
 "Right," answered the man, "but I have forgotten to buckle on my money 
belt. Have no fear, however, you shall have 
security until I pay. I will take two cows with me and leave one, so you 
will have good collateral." 
 The woman saw the wisdom of this, and let the man go away with the 
cows, and thought to herself, "How pleased Hans 
will be when he finds how cleverly I have managed." 
 The peasant came home on the third day as he had said he would, and at 
once inquired if the cows were sold. "Yes, 
indeed, dear Hans," answered the woman, "and as you said, for two hundred 
talers. They are scarcely worth so much, but 
the man took them without making any objection." 
 "Where is the money?" asked the peasant. "Oh, I have not got the 
money," replied the woman. "He had happened to 
forget his money belt, but he will soon bring it, and he left good 
security behind him." 
 "What kind of security?" asked the man. 
 "One of the three cows, which he shall not have until he has paid for 
the other two. I have managed very cunningly, for I 
have kept the smallest, which eats the least." 
 The man was enraged and lifted up his stick, and was just going to give 
her the beating he had promised her, when 
suddenly he lowered the stick and said, "You are the stupidest goose that 
ever waddled on God's earth, but I am sorry for 
you. I will go out into the highway and wait for three days to see if I 
find anyone who is still stupider than you. If I succeed in 
doing so, you shall go free, but if I do not find him, you shall receive 
your well-deserved reward without any discount." 
 He went out into the great highway, sat down on a stone, and waited for 
what would come along. Then he saw a farm 
wagon coming towards him, and a woman was standing upright in the middle 
of it, instead of sitting on the bundle of straw 
which was lying beside her, or walking near the oxen and leading them. 
 The man thought to himself, "That is certainly one of the kind I am in 
search of," and jumped up and ran back and forth 
in front of the wagon like one who is not in his right mind. 
 "What do you want, my friend?" said the woman to him. "I don't know 
you, where do you come from?" 
 "I have fallen down from heaven," replied the man, "and don't know how 
to get back again. Couldn't you drive me 
up?" 
 "No," said the woman, "I don't know the way. But if you come from 
heaven you can surely tell me how my husband is, 
who has been there these three years. You must have seen him." 
 "Oh, yes, I have seen him, but not everyone can get on well. He herds 
sheep, and these creatures give him a great deal 
to do. They run up the mountains and lose their way in the wilderness, and 
he has to run after them and drive them together 
again. His clothes are all torn to pieces too, and will soon fall off his 
body. There is no tailor there, for Saint Peter won't let 
any of them in, as you know by the story." 
 "Who would have thought it?" cried the woman. "I tell you what. I will 
fetch his Sunday coat which is still hanging at 
home in the cupboard. He can wear that and look respectable. You will be 
so kind as to take it with you." 
 "That won't be possible," answered the peasant. "People are not allowed 
to take clothes into heaven. They are taken 
away at the gate." 
 "Then listen to me," said the woman. "I sold my good wheat yesterday 
and got a lot of money for it. I will send that to 
him. If you hide the purse in your pocket, no one will know that you have 
it." 
 "If you can't manage it any other way," said the peasant, "I will do 
you that favor." 
 "Just sit still where you are," said she, "and I will drive home and 
fetch the purse. I shall soon be back again. I do not sit 
down on the bundle of straw, but stand up in the wagon, because it makes 
it lighter for the cattle." 
 She drove her oxen away, and the peasant thought, "That woman has a 
perfect talent for folly. If she really brings the 
money, my wife may think herself fortunate, for she will get no 
beating." 
 It was not long before she came in a great hurry with the money, and 
with her own hands put it in his pocket. Before she 
went away, she thanked him again a thousand times for his courtesy. 
 When the woman got home again, she found her son who had come in from 
the field. She told him what unexpected 
things had befallen her, and then added, "I am truly delighted at having 
found an opportunity of sending something to my 
poor husband. Who would ever have imagined that he could be suffering for 
want of anything up in heaven?" 
 The son was full of astonishment. "Mother," said he, it is not every 
day that a man comes from heaven in this way. I will 
go out immediately, and see if he is still to be found, he must tell me 
what it is like up there, and how the work is done. 
 He saddled the horse and rode off with all speed. He found the peasant 
who was sitting under a willow tree, and was 
about to count the money in the purse. "Have you seen the man who has come 
from heaven?" cried the youth to him. 
 "Yes," answered the peasant, "he has set out on his way back there, and 
has gone up that hill, from whence it will be 
rather nearer. You could still catch him up, if you ride fast." 
 "Alas," said the youth, "I have been doing tiring work all day, and the 
ride here has completely worn me out. You know 
the man. Be so kind as to get on my horse, and go and persuade him to come 
here." 
 "Aha," thought the peasant. "Here is another who has not no wick in his 
lamp." 
 "Why should I not do you this favor?" said he, and mounted the horse 
and rode off at a quick trot. The youth remained 
sitting there until night fell, but the peasant never came back. 
 "The man from heaven must certainly have been in a great hurry, and 
would not turn back," thought he, "and the peasant 
has no doubt given him the horse to take to my father." He went home and 
told his mother what had happened, and that he 
had sent his father the horse so that he might not have to be always 
running about. 
 "You have done well," answered she. "You still have young legs and can 
go on foot." 
 When the peasant got home, he put the horse in the stable beside the 
cow which had been left as security, and then 
went to his wife and said, "Trina, as your luck would have it, I have 
found two who are still more stupid fools than you. This 
time you escape without a beating. I will store it up for another 
occasion."  
 Then he lighted his pipe, sat down in his grandfather's chair, and 
said, "It was a good stroke of business to get a sleek 
horse and a great purse full of money into the bargain, for two lean cows. 
If stupidity always brought in as much as that, I 
would be quite willing to hold it in honor." 
 So thought the peasant, but you no doubt prefer the simpletons.
