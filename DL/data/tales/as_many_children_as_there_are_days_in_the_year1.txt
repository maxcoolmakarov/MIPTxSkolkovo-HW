Loosduynen (Leusden) is a small village one mile from The Hague. In the church there they still point out two baptismal fonts with the
inscription, "In deze twee beckens zyn alle deze kinderen ghedoopt [All
the children were baptized in these two fonts]." A plaque hanging nearby, inscribed with Latin and Dutch verses, commemorates the event described in the following popular legend:
 
Many years ago there lived in the village a Countess Margaretha
(according to others her name was Mathilde), wife of Count Hermann of
Henneberg. Sometimes she is referred to simply as the Countess of Holland.
One day a poor woman carrying twins in her arms approached her and asked
for charity. The countess scolded her, saying, "Get away, you shameless
beggar! It is impossible for a woman to have two children at once from
just one father!"
 The poor woman replied, "Then may God let you have as many children as
there are days in the year!" Some time later the countess became pregnant
and on one day gave birth to 365 children. This happened in the year 1270
(1276), in the countess's forty-third year. These children were all
baptized alive by Guido, the Bishop of Utrecht, in two bronze fonts. All
the boys were named Johannes and the girls Elizabeth. However, within one
day they all died, together with their mother, and all lie buried in one
grave in the village church.
 It is said that there is also a monument to this event in the church at
Delft.
