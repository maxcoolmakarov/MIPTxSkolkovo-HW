He that gives all his geer to his bairns,  
Take up a beetle, and known out his harns [brains].
 
Taken from the history of one John Bell, who having given his whole substance to his children, was by them neglected; after he died there was found in his chest a mallet with this inscription: 
 
I John Bell, leaves here a mell [maul], the man to fell,  
Who gives all to his bairns, and keeps nothing to himself. 
 
English: 
 
He that gives his goods before he be dead,  
Take up a mallet and knock him on the head.
