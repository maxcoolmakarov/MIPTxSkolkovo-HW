One day a little girl was going to see her grandmother. She brought butter and eggs in a basket to her grandmother. Her mother told her to go the pathway, but she did not go the pathway, but she went through a wood, and while she was going a wolf saw her, and he knew where she was going, and he went off before her. When he came to the grandmothers he went in and he devoured her grandmother.  
When the little girl came to her grandmother's house she went into the kitchen. There was nobody there before her. Then she went into the room, and the wolf was inside in bed before her.  
She thought it was her grandmother, and she began talking to the wolf and she said to the wolf, "Isn't it great big ears you've got," and after a awhile she spoke again. She said, "Isn't it great big hands you've got." And then she said to the wolf again, "Isn't it a great big mouth you'e got," and then the wolf sprang, and he was going to eat the little girl, and the little girl began roaring, and there were men cutting wood in the wood, and they heard the roaring, and one of them ran to the house and cut off the wolf's head.  
The little girl escaped.
