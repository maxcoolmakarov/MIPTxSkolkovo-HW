Another Part of this Conversation generally turns upon  Fairies . These, they tell you, have frequently been heard and seen, nay that there are some still living who were stolen away by them, and confined seven Years. According to the Description they give of them, who pretend to have seen them, they are in the Shape of Men, exceeding little: They are always clad in Green, and frequent the Woods and Fields; when they make Cakes (which is a Work they have been often heard at) they are very noisy; and when they have done, they are full of Mirth and Pastime. But generally they dance in  Moon-Light  when Mortals are asleep, and not capable of seeing them, as may be observed on the following Morn; their dancing Places being very distinguishable. For as they dance Hand in Hand, and so make a  Circle  in their Dance, so next Day there will be seen  Rings  and  Circles  on the Grass.
 
Now in all this there is really nothing, but an old fabulous Story, which has been handed down even to our Days from the Times of  Heathenism , of a certain Sort of Beings called Lami√¶, which were esteemed so mischievous and cruel, as to take away young Children and slay them. These, together with the the  Fauns , the  Gods of the Woods , seem to have formed the Notion of Fairies.
