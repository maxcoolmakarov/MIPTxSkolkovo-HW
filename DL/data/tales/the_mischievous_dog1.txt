There was once a dog who used to snap at people and bite them without any 
provocation, and who was a great nuisance to 

everyone who came to his master's house. So his master fastened a bell 
round his neck to warn people of his presence. 

The dog was very proud of the bell, and strutted about tinkling it with 
immense satisfaction. But an old dog came up 

to him and said, "The fewer airs you give yourself the better, my friend. 
You don't think, do you, that your bell was 

given you as a reward of merit? On the contrary, it is a badge of 
disgrace."  
 Moral: Notoriety is often mistaken for fame.
