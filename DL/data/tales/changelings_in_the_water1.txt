German Legends   
Near Halberstadt a peasant had a killcrop that sucked its mother and five 
wet nurses dry, all the while eating voraciously (for they eat more than 
ten other children).  It behaved in such a manner that they became tired 
of it.  The peasant was advised that he should take the child on a 
pilgrimage in praise of the Virgin Mary to Heckelstadt and have him 
weighed at that place.
 
The good peasant followed this advice.  He put the child in a pack basket 
and set forth carrying it on his back.  He was about to cross over a 
stream on a bridge when he heard a shout from the water beneath him: 
"Killcrop!  Killcrop!"
  
The child in the basket, who had until now never spoken a word, answered: 
"Ho!  Ho!"  The peasant did not expect this, and it startled him.
  
Then the devil in the water asked further: "Where are you going?"
  
The killcrop above answered "I am going to Heckelstadt to our Dear Lady, 
and have myself weighed, that I might thrive."
  
When the peasant heard that the changeling could talk perfectly well, he 
became angry and threw him, together with the basket, into the water.  
Then the two devils came together, cried out "Ho!  Ho!  Ha!" and 
frolicked and jousted with one another, and then disappeared.
