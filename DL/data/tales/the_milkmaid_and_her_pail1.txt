A farmer's daughter had been out to milk the cows, and was returning to
the dairy carrying her pail of milk upon her head.  As she walked along,
she fell a-musing after this fashion: 
 The milk in this pail will provide me with cream, which I will
make into butter and take to market to sell.  With the money I will buy a
number of eggs, and these, when hatched, will produce chickens, and by and
by I shall have quite a large poultry yard.  Then I shall sell some of my
fowls, and with the money which they will bring in I will buy myself a new
gown, which I shall wear when I go to the fair; and all the young fellows
will admire it, and come and make love to me, but I shall toss my head and
have nothing to say to them. 
 Forgetting all about the pail, and suiting the action to the word, she
tossed her head.  Down went the pail, all the milk was spilled, and all
her fine castles in the air vanished in a moment! 
 
 
 
 Moral: 
 
 Do not count your chickens before they are
hatched.
