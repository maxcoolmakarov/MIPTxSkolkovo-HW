Once upon a time there was a very poor man who wished to take Charon as his godfather, and actually did so. Because he was now so poor, Charon advised him to become a doctor. In this way he would become wealthy.  
Charon said: "If you see me sitting at the foot of the sick man, give him a few drops of colored water, and he will recover. If you see me sitting next to his body, do the same. But if you see me sitting close to his head, then you must say: 'The sick person will die; he cannot recover,' and go away."  
The man did so. He became a famous doctor and acquired untold wealth.  
One day he he asked Godfather Charon: "You are not going to take me away now, are you?"  
"No," Charon answered him, "I'll not take you away until three years from now."  
Then the man left his homeland to escape from Charon, and after a year's wanderings he arrived in a place where he thought Charon would not find him.  
However, just three years after he had left home, while he was drinking coffee in a coffee house, Charon suddenly appeared before him and said: "Hello, godson! I haven't seen you for three years! It is now time for me to take your soul."  
The doctor answered: "No, dear godfather, no, dear Charon, don't take my soul. Let me live!"  
But Charon replied: "No, I have no choice. God sent me."  
And without further ado Charon took his soul. He was not even able to finish his coffee.  
Charon recognizes neither friendship nor kinship nor mercy. All people are equal in his eyes, and wherever they may flee, Charon knows how to find them.
