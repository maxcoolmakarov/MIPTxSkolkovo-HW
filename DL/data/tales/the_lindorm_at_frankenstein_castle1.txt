The extensive ruins of Frankenstein Castle lie above the village of Eberstadt, two hours from Darmstadt. There lived there a knight named Hans, although others say his name was George. In the village there flowed a spring from which the peasants drew their water, and water from there was also carried up to the castle.  
A fearsome lindorm lived next to the spring, and he demanded the sacrifice of a not-too-small animal -- a sheep, a dog, a calf, or a hog, and as long as he had these to eat, anyone could come to the spring. But if these failed, he devoured the people who came to the spring.   
Finally the Knight of Frankenstein decided to free the village and the region of this dangerous monster. He armed himself and fought with the lindorm, who fiercely defended himself, spitting out as much fire as was possible.  Finally the knight struck off the lindorm's head, but the dragon's pointed tail wrapped itself around the knight, sticking him where he was not covered by his armor: in the hollow of his knee. 
The lindorm's entire body was poisonous -- both inside and outside, and thus the brave Knight of Frankenstein died from the dragon's poison.  
Afterward he was buried with his forefathers in the church at Niederbeerbach (others say it was at Oberbeerbach), where the Frankensteiners have beautiful grave monuments. There they built a stately monument for the knight, life-sized and equipped with armor, sword, and mace. He is depicted standing on the lindorm, whose tail is pointed at the hollow of the knight's knee. Angels are crowning him: an authentic image of the Christian martyr and saint, the knight Saint George.
