Every schoolboy knows the story of the blockhead who complained to the 
judge of being annoyed with flies, and being told that he was at liberty 
to strike them wherever he saw them, observing a big "blue bottle" alight 
on the judge's nose, delivered a blow with his fist on that useful member, 
and smashed it as well as the fly.
