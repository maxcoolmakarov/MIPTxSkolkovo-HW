Bill Robertson, æt. 71, residing in Lerwick, soberly narrated this 
trowy story:  
My midder, God rest her soul, tauld me this, and she nedder could nor wid 
ha' tauld me a lee.  Shü wis staying wi' freends at 
Kirgood-a-Weisdale; an' ee nicht about da hüming (twilight) da 
guidman was sair fashed, for da honest wife haed just haed a pirie baby.
 
An' noo, my lamb 'at ye ir (are), what sud he hear juist as he was gaein' 
ta leave the lamb-house, but three most unearthly knocks, da sam as it 
haed a been frae onder da grund.  Noo, he kent na what dis could be, but 
he made a' fast, an' gangs up intil de corn yard, and as he comes in 
sight of the screws he hears a voice 'at said tree times, "Mind da 
crooked finger."
 
Noo, his wife haed a crooked finger, and he kent ower weel 'at something 
wis gaen ta happen, for his  grey neebors  wis apon da watch for da 
helpless infant, or midder, or baith.  So he comes into da hoose, an' 
lichts a candle, taks doon da Bible, an' a steel knife.  He opens da buik 
an' da knife, when such a roaring and  trüling,  an' onerthly 
stamping an' rattling, an' confusion comes frae da byre as made da whole 
hoose shak.  An' a' body fell a-whaaking (quaking).
 
Noo, he taks da open Bible, and maks for da byre, an' dem 'at wis i' da 
hoos follows him trimbling an' whaaking, only da wise-woman bein' left 
with da poor wife an' infant.  Noo, whin he gets ta da door, he heaves in 
da Bible afore him, sticks da open knive in his mouth, edge ootwards, and 
da lowin' candle in een o' his hands.  Da instant yon was dune da 
trülin' an' noise an' din ceased all of a sudden, and da image 'at 
haed been prepared for ta pit i' da place i' da poor wife an' innocent 
pirie lamb was a' 'at was left i' da byre.
 
"Weel," says da guidman, as he gripped in his airms da very likeness o' 
his wife 'at da trows had left i' da byre, "I've taen dee, and I'll use 
dee."  Weel, he tuk in ta da hoose da image left by da trows, an' it haed 
every joint an' pairt of a woman.  An' my midder tauld me shü saw 
it, an' da honest folk for mony a year, an' der children after dem, sat 
upon da stock, or image, or likness; an' things was set on it, and wood 
was sawn on it.
 
An' dat's as true as I'm spekin' to you, and no a borrowed or handed 
story; for my midder tauld me it wi' her ain lips, an' she wid no a tauld 
me a lee."
