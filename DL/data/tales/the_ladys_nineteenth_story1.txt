In the by-gone time an old gardener had mounted his son upon an ass and 
was proceeding to the garden, himself on foot.    
They met some men who said, "See this old pederast, how he has mounted the 
boy upon the ass; and is himself running alongside."    
Whenever the old man heard this he made the boy alight and mounted 
himself.    
Again they met some other folk, these likewise said, "Look at this 
heartless old man, he rides the ass himself and makes the poor child go on 
foot."    
Whenever the old man heard this he took his son up in front of him.    
Then some people saw them and said, "See this old pederast, how he has 
taken the boy up in front of him."    
The old man heard this, and he put his son up behind him.    
Again certain folks saw them and said, "See this old catamite, how he has 
taken the boy up behind him."    
The old man knew not what to do, so he put his son down and alighted 
himself and drove the ass before them. The garden was near, and both of 
them were on foot, and they reached the garden before meeting with any 
others.
