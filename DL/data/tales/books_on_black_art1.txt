Books on Black Art were got in Scotland by those who went to work there during the Harvest.  
It was against the law to sell or buy these but it was done. A Â£1 was left on a certain place and while one watched a hand appeared took the money and shortly afterwards put the required book in its place.  
At the beginning of each book these words were written:  
 
Read me through  
But pursue me not,  
For if you do  
Hell and damnation will be your lot.
