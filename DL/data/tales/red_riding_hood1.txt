One time there lived a little girl. Her name was Red Riding Hood. She was dressed in a coat of red, and she wore a hood on her head. That was why she was called Red Riding Hood. She lived beside a wood. This little girl had a granny who lived the far side of the wood. One day she was ill, and Red Riding Hood's mother sent her with a basket of goods to her granny.  
When she was going through the wood she met a wolf. The wolf asked her where she was going. She told him she was going to her granny who was ll. When the wolf heard the news he ran on before her and got into her granny's cottage and killed her. Then he got into the bed and put the granny's glasses on his eyes. Then he got her nightgown and put it on. Next he got her night cap and put it on his head. Then he got into the bed and covered himself up.  
After a while he heard a knock at the door. The wolf told the little girl to come in. When the little girl came in she wondered how strange looking her granny was. Before she had said the words the wolf leaped out of the bed. Then the little girl began to scream. Her father was cutting timber in the wood. When he heard the noise he ran in and killed the wolf.  
When he had the wolf killed the little girl's granny jumped out of the wolf's stomach again.
