Once there was a fox an' a rabbit. They was in partnership. The rabbit 
used to go fishing a lot. The rabbit told the fox he could show him where 
there was a nice lot of fish.   
The rabbit said, "Don't pull up until you feel your tail getting stiff an' 
heavy."   
After a while the fox said, "My tail getting heavy, can I pull up?"   
Rabbit said, "No, don't pull up yet. Wait till you get a few more on. Pull 
up now! You got a nice bunch on."   
His tail stuck, was froze.   
"That's just what I wanted, Mr. Fox, you treated me so dirty."
