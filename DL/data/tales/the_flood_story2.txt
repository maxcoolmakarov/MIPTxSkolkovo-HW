A long time ago there was a very big crab which crawled into the sea. And 
when he went in he crowded the water out so that it ran all over the earth 
and covered all the land.   
Now about one moon before this happened, a wise man had told the people 
that they must build a large raft. They did as he commanded and cut many 
large trees, until they had enough to make three layers. These they bound 
tightly together, and when it was done they fastened the raft with a long 
rattan cord to a big pole in the earth.   
Soon after this the floods came. White water poured out of the hills, and 
the sea rose and covered even the highest mountains. The people and 
animals on the raft were safe, but all the others drowned.   
When the waters went down and the raft was again on the ground, it was 
near their old home, for the rattan cord had held.   
But these were the only people left on the whole earth.
