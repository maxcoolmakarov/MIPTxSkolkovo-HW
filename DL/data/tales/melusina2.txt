In BÃ¤ringen during a wind storm they say that "Melusina is crying
for her children." This must be true, because otherwise on Christmas Eve,
at which time one is supposed to eat nine kinds of food, they would not
shake the leftovers from the tablecloth onto a bush so that Melusina,
sometimes also known as St. Melusina, might also have something to
eat.
