The fairies are the  Tuatha De Danaans . Most people believe in fairies. Now those fairies are supposed to live in the old forts. Many people are afraid of the anger of the fairies. There are many old tales told about the fairies. When young children do not do as they are told, their mothers threaten to bring them to the fairies. The fairies are very important to the people in Ireland. No one has ever done any harm to them.
