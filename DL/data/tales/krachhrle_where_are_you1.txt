In the valley between Wehr and Hasel there was a hole in the ground. A man assumed that there was a badger inside it. He sent his dog into the hole while firmly holding an open sack at its opening. Before long something jumped into the sack. The man immediately tied it shut, lifted it onto his back, and went on his way.  
Suddenly an elf cried out from nearby: "Krach√∂hrle! Where are you?" 
A voice answered: "On his shoulders in the sack!"  
The man now knew that instead of a badger he had captured an elf, and without delay he turned it loose.
