German Legends   
The following story was told to Pr√§torius by a student, whose mother 
claimed that it happened in Dessau.
  
A woman gave birth to a child and laid it next to herself.  She fell into 
a deep sleep.  The child had not yet been baptized.  At midnight two 
underground women came in and made a fire on the hearth.  They placed a 
kettle of water over the fire.  Then they bathed the child they had 
brought with them in the water, and carried it into the woman's room 
where they exchanged it for her sleeping child.
  
They took the child away, but upon arriving at the first hill, they began 
fighting over it, throwing it back and forth at each other like a ball.  
The child began to cry, which woke up the housemaid.  She looked at the 
underground women's child and realized that an exchange had taken place.  
She ran to the front of the house, where she found the women arguing 
about the stolen child.  She stepped into the fray and caught the child 
as they were throwing it back and forth.  With the child in her arms she 
ran home.  She placed the changeling outside the door, and the hill-women 
came and took it back.
