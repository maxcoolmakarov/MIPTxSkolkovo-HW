The Merrow, or if you write it in the Irish,  Moruadh   or
 Murr√∫ghach,   from  muir,   sea, and  oigh,   a maid, is not uncommon, they say, on the
wilder coasts.  The fishermen do not like to see them, for it always means
coming gales.   
The male Merrows (if you can use such a phrase -- I have never heard the
masculine of Merrow) have green teeth, green hair, pig's eyes, and red
noses; duck-like scale between their fingers.   
Sometimes they prefer, small blame to them, good-looking fishermen to
their sea lovers.  Near Bantry in the last century, there is said to have
been a woman covered all over with scales like a fish, who was descended
from such a marriage.  Sometimes they come out of the sea, and wander
about the shore in the shape of little hornless cows.   
They have, when in their own shape, a red cap, called a  cohullen
druith,   usually covered with feathers.  If this is stolen, they
cannot again go down under the waves.
Red is the color of magic in every country, and has been so from the very
earliest times.  The caps of fairies and magicians are well-nigh always
red.
