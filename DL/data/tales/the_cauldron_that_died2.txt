One day Johha borrowed a large  tanjera , or copper saucepan, from 
a neighbor for domestic use. Next day he returned it together with a very 
small but quite new one. 
 "What is this?" asked the surprised owner.  
 "Your  tanjera  gave birth to a young one during the night," 
replied the jester, and, in spite of the incredulity of the other man, 
maintained his assertion, refusing to take back the smaller 
 tanjera , on the ground that the young belonged to the parent and 
the parent's owner. Besides, it was cruel to separate so young a child 
from its mother. After a deal of protestation, the neighbor, believing him 
mad, resolved to humor him, and took the small  tanjera , greatly 
wondering at the jester's whim. 
 Its point was revealed to his chagrin some days later, when Johha came 
and borrowed a large and valuable copper  dist , or cauldron. This he 
did not return, but carried it off to another town, where he sold it.  
 When its owner sent to Johha to reclaim it, the knave said that he 
regretted his inability to send it back, but the utensil had unfortunately 
died and been devoured by hyenas.  
 "What!" exclaimed the owner angrily. "Do you think me fool enough to 
believe that?"  
 "Well, my friend," was the reply, "wonderful things sometimes happen. 
You allowed yourself to be persuaded that your  tanjera , for 
instance, gave birth to a young one. Why, then, should you not believe 
that your  dist , which is simply a grown-up  tanjera , should 
die?"  
 In the circumstances, the argument seemed unanswerable, especially 
when, after searching through Johha's house, the cauldron could not be 
found.
