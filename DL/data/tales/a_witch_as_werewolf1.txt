Once a witch was crossing a field in the form of a werewolf in order to
bewitch a farmer's cows.  Her husband came upon her, and when he saw the
wolf, he was afraid that it might be his wife, so he called out, "Marie,
Marie, what are you doing here?"  
This frightened the woman, who turned herself back into her human form.
But even as the man approached her, long red hair was still hanging from
her neck and breast, and her eyes were still glowing like wolf's eyes.
