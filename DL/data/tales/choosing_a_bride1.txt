A man wanted to select a wife for himself from among three sisters, all
of whom pleased him greatly. He invited them all to eat their noon meal
with him at an inn. Wanting to find himself an industrious and efficient
housewife, he decided to test them on how they ate cheese. 
 When her cheese was served the eldest cut the rind off so thick that it
included a lot of good cheese, which was thus lost. "She will waste too
much and throw out everything," thought the man. "You cannot choose
her." 
 Then the second sister received her cheese, and she ate her piece
without cutting off any of the rind. "She is not the wife for you either,"
thought the man. "She will be disorderly." 
 Then the youngest sister was served her cheese. She scraped her piece
off cleanly and carefully, and then ate it. Thus the suitor thought, "She
is the right one!" and he did indeed marry her.
