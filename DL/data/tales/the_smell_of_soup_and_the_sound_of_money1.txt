A beggar was given a piece of bread, but nothing to put on it. Hoping 
to get something to go with his bread, he went to a nearby inn and asked 
for a handout. The innkeeper turned him away with nothing, but the beggar 
sneaked into the kitchen where he saw a large pot of soup cooking over the 
fire. He held his piece of bread over the steaming pot, hoping to thus 
capture a bit of flavor from the good-smelling vapor.  
 Suddenly the innkeeper seized him by the arm and accused him of 
stealing soup.  
 "I took no soup," said the beggar. "I was only smelling the vapor." 
 
 "Then you must pay for the smell," answered the innkeeper.  
 The poor beggar had no money, so the angry innkeeper dragged him before 
the qadi.  
 Now Nasreddin Hodja was at that time serving as qadi, and he heard the 
innkeeper's complaint and the beggar's explanation.  
 "So you demand payment for the smell of your soup?" summarized the 
Hodja after the hearing.  
 "Yes!" insisted the innkeeper.  
 "Then I myself will pay you," said the Hodja, "and I will pay for the 
smell of your soup with the sound of money."  
 Thus saying, the Hodja drew two coins from his pocket, rang them 
together loudly, put them back into his pocket, and sent the beggar and 
the innkeeper each on his own way.
