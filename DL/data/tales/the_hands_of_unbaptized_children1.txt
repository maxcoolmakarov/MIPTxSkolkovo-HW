The body of a deceased, unbaptized child should be buried at night so that no one will know where the grave is. The hands of such children can open any lock.  Furthermore, a thief who possesses the hand from such a corpse can tell whether anyone is awake in a house that he intends to rob. He has only to light the fingers. If they all burn then everyone in the house is asleep, and will no awaken as long as the fingers are burning. The number of fingers not burning shows how many of the house's inhabitants are awake.
