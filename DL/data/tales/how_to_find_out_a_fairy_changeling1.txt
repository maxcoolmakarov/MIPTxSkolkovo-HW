Notes on the Folk-Lore of the North-East of 
Scotland  
If the child became cross and began to  dwine  [waste away], fears 
immediately arose that it might be a "fairy changeling," and the trial by 
fire was put into operation.  The hearth was piled with peat, and when 
the fire was at its strength the suspected changeling was placed in front 
of it and as near as possible not to be scorched, or it was suspended in 
a basket over the fire.  If it was a "changeling child" it made its 
escape by the  lum   [chimney] throwing back word of scorn as it 
disappeared.
  
One mode of bringing back the true child was the following.  A new 
 skull  [an oblong basket] was taken and hung over the fire from a 
piece of a branch of a hazel tree, and into this basket the suspected 
changeling was laid.  Careful watch was kept till it screamed.  If it 
screamed it was a changeling, and it was held fast to prevent its 
escape.  When an opportunity occurred, it was carried to a place where 
four roads met, and a dead body was carried over it.  The true child was 
restored.
