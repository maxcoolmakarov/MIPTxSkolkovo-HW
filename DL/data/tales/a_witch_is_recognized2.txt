Whenever a certain peasant brewed beer, someone drank it all up during 
the night. He finally decided to stay up and keep watch throughout the 
night.  
 He did this, and as he was standing by his vat, a large number of cats 
approached him. He called out to them:  
 Here kitty,  
Here cat,  
Come and warm yourselves! 
 Then they all sat down in a large circle around the fire and warmed 
themselves.  
 After they had sat there for a little while, he asked them if the water 
was hot.  
 "It is almost boiling!" they answered, and as soon as they said this, 
he took the ladle and sprinkled the whole lot of them, whereupon they all 
disappeared in an instant.  
 The next day his wife had a badly burned face, so he knew who had been 
drinking up his beer.
