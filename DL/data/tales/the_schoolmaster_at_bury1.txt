Old Mr. Hodgson, master of the grammar school at Bury, was enjoying his 
midday meal, when his wooden trencher began to turn round, and he was 
immediately convinced that something very wrong was going on in the 
schoolhouse. So he hastened thither, and found the boys in great 
consternation, for by means of saying the Lord's Prayer backwards they had 
raised the devil, and they could not lay him again.   
Mr. Hodgson knew that the only way to get rid of him would be to give him 
a task which he could not perform, and that, if in three trials they could 
not hit upon such a task, the case would be hopeless.   
Mr. Hodgson first desired him to count the blades of grass in the castle 
croft. This task the devil performed directly. He was next ordered to 
count the grains of sand on the school brow. This gave him no more trouble 
than the former feat. Only one chance was left. A happy thought occurred 
to Mr. Hodgson. He commanded the devil to count the letters in the large 
Bible in the parish church. In an instant the devil descended to the lower 
regions through the floor of the school, leaving a great crack on the 
hearthstone where he passed through, to attest the truth of this story to 
future generations.
