In Lake Galenbeck (in the vicinity of Friedland) there is a tongue of 
land, probably artificial, that stretches about to the middle of the lake. 
It is called the devil's bridge, and is said to be the remains of a bridge 
started, but never completed, by the devil.  
 A shepherd had to drive his herd completely around the lake in order to 
reach his pasture. This annoyed him, and one day he wished with a curse 
that a bridge went across the lake. He had scarcely uttered this wish when 
a man appeared before him. The man promised to build a bridge in one 
night, before the rooster crowed three times, under the condition that the 
shepherd would then belong to him. The shepherd entered into this 
agreement.  
 That evening when he arrived home, he told his wife what had happened. 
She said nothing, but at midnight she went to the chicken coop and 
awakened the rooster, who thought that it was already morning, and crowed 
three times.  
 The devil heard this. He was not finished with his work, and angrily 
flew off through the air without completing the bridge.
