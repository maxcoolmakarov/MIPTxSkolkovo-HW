Three goats went into a grove to eat leaves. The first had one little
belly, the second had two little bellies, and the third had three little
bellies. 
The one with one little belly was soon full and was the first to go home.
But a wolf laid himself across the narrow mountain path and said, "Run!
Run, or I'll eat you up!" 
The goat said, "Don't eat me up. I am very skinny, but a goat will soon
come who has two little bellies. He will fill you up." And the wolf let
him go. 
Then came the second goat, the one with two little bellies, and who was
now full. The wolf said to him as well, "Run! Run, or I'll eat you up!" 
He said, "Don't eat me up. I am only half meat, but a goat will soon come
who has three little bellies, and who will fill you up completely." And
the wolf let him go as well. 
Then came the third goat, the one with three little bellies. He had
finally gotten full. 
The wolf said to him, "Run! Run, or I'll eat you up!" 
This goat said nothing in return, but instead, brave and forward as he
was, lowered his horns and gave the wolf such a blow that he fell from the
cliff into the chasm below and broke his right leg. And there the poor
rascal lay. He wanted the biggest and fattest mouthfull, but instead got
nothing -- but pain.
