King Olaf of Norway, engrossed in thought, wandered between mountain and 
valley.  He wanted to build a church whose equal could not be found far 
and wide, but he realized that he could not do so without severely taxing 
his kingdom.  While sadly pondering this problem he met a man of curious 
appearance, who asked him why he was so contemplative.  Olaf revealed the 
problem to him, and the giant (or troll) offered to accomplish the task 
for him within a certain time.  His reward would be the sun and the moon 
or Saint Olaf himself.
 
Olaf entered into this agreement, but then drew up plans that he thought 
would be impossible to execute.  The church was to be so large that seven 
priests would be able to preach in it at one time without disturbing one 
another.  The pillars and decorations, both inside and out, were to be of 
hard flint, and so forth.
 
Soon such a church was standing there, complete except for roof and 
steeple.  Deeply concerned, Olaf again wandered through the mountains and 
valleys.  Suddenly, from within a mountain, he a child crying and a 
giantess comforting it with the words:
 
 Shush, shush,
 tomorrow your father,
 Wind and Weather,
 will come home,
 and he will bring you
 the sun and the moon
 or Saint Olaf himself!
 
 
Olaf returned home, elated with this discovery (for one can destroy an 
evil spirit's power with his name).  Everything was finished.  The 
steeple had just been set into place.  Then Olaf called out:
 
 
Vind och Veder! 
 du har satt spiran sneder! 
(Wind and Weather, 
you have set the steeple on crooked!)
 
 
The giant fell from the top of the church with a horrible crash, and 
burst into many pieces of flintstone.
