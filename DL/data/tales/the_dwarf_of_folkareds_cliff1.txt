It is probably that there are few places more gloomy and uninviting
than certain parts of the parish of Sibbarp, in the Province of Halland.
Dark heaths cover a good portion of the parish, and from their dull brown
surface rises, here and there, a lonely, cheerless mountain. One of these
is Folkared's Cliff, in the southern part of the parish, noted of old as
the abiding place of little trolls and dwarfs. 
 One chilly autumn day a peasant, going from Hogared, in Ljungby, to
Folkared, in Sibbarp, in order to shorten his journey took a shortcut by
way of the cliff, upon reaching which he perceived a dwarf about the size
of a child seven or eight years old, sitting upon a stone crying. 
 "Where is your home?" asked the peasant, moved by the seeming distress
of the little fellow. 
 "Here," sobbed the dwarf, pointing to the mountain. 
 "How long have you lived here?" questioned the peasant in surprise. 
 "Six hundred years." 
 "Six hundred years! You lie, you rascal, and you deserve to be whipped
for it." 
 "Oh! Do not strike me," pleaded the dwarf, continuing to cry. "I have
had enough of blows already today." 
 "Who have you received them from?" asked the peasant. 
 "From my father." 
 "What capers did you cut up that you were thus punished?" 
 "Oh, I was set to watch my old grandfather and when I chanced to turn
my back he fell and hurt himself upon the floor." 
 The peasant then understood what character of person he had met, and
grasping his dirk he prepared to defend himself. But instantly he heard an
awful crash in the mountain, and the dwarf had vanished.
