In the falltime when the people around Neubistritz are laying flax in the ponds late at evening they hear the wild hunt. In the woods near the ponds a a terrible commotion commences: trees crack; dogs bark; and everywhere "haho! haho!" sounds forth up and down. Then the people rush homeward from the fields, for anyone who gets caught up in the wild hunt can go no further against the storm and wind.   
If anyone calls back "haho," that evening the wild huntsman will throw the hind quarter of a horse through his window. It gives off a horrible smell, and one cannot get rid of it. However often one throws it away, it always reappears in the same place. But if one cooks it and buries it beneath the roof drain, it will disappear as soon as raindrops fall on it. (Dr. Ruschko from Neubistritz)   
Forester Grünwald from Studena tells that he once saw the wild hunt passing over him. Instead of throwing himself to the ground he fired his gun at them. A terrible bang followed, and a large owl fell wounded at his feet. (B. Pick from Studena)   
In Schönlinde the wild huntsman is called Banditterch (Berndietrich). He is said to conduct his hunt with wood-dogs [wolves] in Schweinsgründen and in Budersdorf. (A. Stellzig from Schönlinde)   
In the Braunau district he is called the forest huntsman. On certain days he rides around in the wooods with four fiery dogs. Four glowing chickens run ahead of him, which are said to be deceased souls from hell. (F. Kahler from Braunau)   
In the Riesengebirge Mountains they say that the wild huntsman's followers are Frederick the Great's Prussian soldiers who were killed there. Every year on certain days they are said to rise up and attempt to return through the air to Prussia. However, they cannot find their way out of Bohemia and therefore turn around with horrible shouts. They kill anyone they meet who does not throw himself down with his face to the ground.
