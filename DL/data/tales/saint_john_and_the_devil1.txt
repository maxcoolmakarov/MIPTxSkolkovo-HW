Saint John and the devil were sitting together on the roof of a house. 
They made a wager as to who would first be able to string together a 
certain number of small wooden shingles. Saint John took only short pieces 
of string, pulled them through the nail holes, then tied all the strings 
together, and thus he had all the shingles strung together.  
On the other hand, the devil clumsily took hold of a very long string and 
worked feverishly away. Because his string was always getting tangled up, 
the devil had to keep running back and forth in order to untangle it, and 
he was only half finished when Saint John had completed his work.  
The devil was very angry at having lost this first wager. He then pointed 
to a field and said, "Let us take what is growing there and share it, each 
of us to receive half. Do you want the top or the bottom?"  
Saint John looked and saw that it was a field of turnips. He chose the 
bottom half. The devil was happy to get the top half, thinking that it was 
the best part, the bottom part being only thin, bitter roots.  
The two returned when the turnips had grown and were ready to harvest. 
Then the devil received only a little pile of half-withered, wormy leaves, 
whereas Saint John received a large pile of the most beautiful and 
juiciest turnips.  
When the devil became angry again, Saint John pointed to another field and 
asked, "Do you want to wager once again?"  
"Yes indeed," replied the devil, "but this time I'll take the bottom 
half."  
"Then I'll take the top part," said John.  
However, this field was planted with wheat, and when harvest time came, 
Saint John received the beautiful heads, heavy with grain, while the devil 
was left with the naked stubble.  
The devil did not enter into any new wagers, but instead, filled with 
anger and rage, returned to hell.
