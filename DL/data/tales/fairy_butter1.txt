The Denham Tracts 
Mothers sometimes brought the cradle to the field in the harvest time and 
left it at the ridge end, when the little inmate would be liable to be 
exchanged for one of fairy breed.  To deter children who gleaned behind 
the reapers from interfering with the stooks, it was customary to tell 
them that baits of "fairy butter" were placed among the sheaves, and if 
they were tempted to touch and eat it the fairies would kidnap them.
  
A story is told at Pierse Bridge how that, some women going into the 
field to work rather earlier one morning than usual, now some fifty or 
sixty years ago, found as much as nearly a pound upon the top of a 
gatepost, how they carefully gathered it into a basin, and how they each 
and all partook, and found it to be the "nicest butther that ony o' them 
had iver ta√§sted."
