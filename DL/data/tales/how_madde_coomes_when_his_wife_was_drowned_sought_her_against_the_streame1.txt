Coomes of Stapforth, hearing that his wife was drowned coming from market, went with certayne of his friends to see if they could find her in the river. He, contrary to all the rest, sought his wife against the streame; which they perceyving, sayd he lookt the wrong way.    
And why so? (quoth he).    
Because (quoth they) you should looke downe the steame, and not against it.    
Nay, zounds (quoth hee), I shall never find her that way; for shee did all things so contrary in her life time, that now she is dead, I am sure she will goe against the streame.
