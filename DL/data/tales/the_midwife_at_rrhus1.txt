Sigrid, a midwife at Rørhus in Sundelven parish, was once taken by a huldre-man to his wife who was having difficulty giving birth.  
Sigrid succeeded at her craft, and after the baby was born, the huldre-man took it and went away with it to Sigrid's neighbor woman at Rørhus, and exchanged it for her new-born child, since she too had recently given birth. He stated aloud that the exchange would last as long as their cowshed was standing.   
Sigrid was taken back home, and the underground-man gave her a wooden box and a basket packed with sweets and food for her help with the huldre-woman.  
Concerning the changeling given to Sigrid's neighbor woman: When he grew up he remained a true huldre-fellow who often had dealings with his companions -- saw them in broad daylight, conversed with them, and saw their cattle grazing near Rørhus. He saw how milking was done by the Huldre-people, how they prepared curdled milk, and so forth.   
When the woman saw that he was completely preoccupied with the undergound people, she realized that he was a changeling, and she wanted to get her real son back from the underground people. She recalled the words that the Huldre-fellow had said when the exchange had taken place: that it would last as long as their cowshed was standing. Thus she had the cowshed burned down. The scurvy troll disappeared, and the Rørhus woman got her right child back.
