The Publicity Bureau has issued the following note:
 
Foolish rumors have been about Madras now for a week to the effect that a
child was to be sacrificed at the site of the new bridge. The rumors
apparently took their rise in the fact that one Muhammadan and three Hindu
children have been missing in Madras and have not yet been traced, though
the circumstances attending their disappearance did not suggest foul play.
 
But once rumor had got about, false alarms began to be raised whenever a
child slipped out of sight for a few minutes. Thus people's minds became
excited and they fell into a panic. As a result, in the last two days
several innocent people have been savagely assulted by excited crowds in
different parts of the town, having come under suspicion for perfectly
innocent actions. Thus, one man seen carrying his own child on a
motorcycle was stopped and assulted. A person appears to have been beaten
to death.
 
The Commissioner of Police has taken all possible steps to restore
confidence, and the Coproration has been invited to assist. It is hoped
that all members of the public will help in allaying this foolish panic
which has already had such tragic consequences. Investigations show no
reason to suppose that any gang of kidnappers is at work in Madras. To
calm the public alarm special precautions are being taken and special
vigilance is being exercised.
