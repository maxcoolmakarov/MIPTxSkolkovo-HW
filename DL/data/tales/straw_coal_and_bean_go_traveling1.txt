A straw, a coal, and a bean formed a group in order to take a long trip 
together. They had already gone through many lands when they came to a 
brook with no bridge, and they could not get across. Finally Straw came 
upon a good idea. He would lay himself over the water, and the others 
would walk across him, first Coal and then Bean. Coal walked ahead, and 
Bean came tripping after. But when Coal reached the middle of the straw, 
it caught fire and burned through. Coal fell into the water hissing, and 
died. Straw floated away in two pieces.  
 Bean, who had lagged behind, also slid in, but he managed to keep 
barely afloat by swimming. However, he swallowed so much water that he 
burst, and in this condition drifted ashore. Fortunately a tailor was 
sitting there, resting from his travels. He had needle and thread at hand, 
and he sewed Bean back together. And from that time forth, all beans have 
had a seam.  
 According to another story, it was the bean who first walked across the 
straw. He got across safely, and from the opposite bank watched the coal 
attempt to cross. Midway the coal burned the straw in two, and fell into 
the water hissing. When the bean saw this, he laughed so loudly that he 
burst. The tailor, who was sitting on the bank, sewed him back together, 
but he had only black thread, and for this reason all beans have a black 
seam.
