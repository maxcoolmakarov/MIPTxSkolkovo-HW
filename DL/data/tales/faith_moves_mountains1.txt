The Hodja was boasting about the power of his faith.  
 "If your faith is so strong, then pray for that mountain to come to 
you," said a skeptic, pointing to a mountain in the distance.  
 The Hodja prayed fervently, but the mountain did not move. He prayed 
more, but the mountain remained unmoved.  
 Finally the Hodja got up from his knees and began walking toward the 
mountain. "I am a humble man," he said, "and the faith of Islam is a 
practical one. If the mountain will not come to the Hodja, then the Hodja 
will go to the mountain."
