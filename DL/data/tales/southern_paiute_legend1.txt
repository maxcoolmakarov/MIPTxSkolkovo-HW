Si-chom-pa Ka-gon (Old Woman of the Sea) came out of the sea with a sack 
filled with something, and securely tied. Then she went back to the home 
of the Shin-au-av brothers. She delivered to them the sack and told them 
to carry it to the middle of the world and open it. There they would meet 
Tov-wots, who would tell them what to do with it. Shin-au-av-pa-vits (the 
elder) gave the sack to Shin-au-av-skaits (the younger) and told him to do 
as Si-chom-pa Ka-gon had directed, and especially enjoined upon him that 
he must not open the sack lest some calamity should befall him.  
As he proceeded, his curiosity overcame him, and he untied the sack, when 
out sprang hosts of people who passed out on the plain, shouting and 
running toward the mountain.  
Then Tov-wots suddenly appeared, being very angry. "Why have you done 
this? I wanted these people to live in that good land to the east, and 
here, foolish boy, you have let them out in a desert."
