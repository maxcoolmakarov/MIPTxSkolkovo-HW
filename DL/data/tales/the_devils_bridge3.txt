There is a curious legend connected with a bridge which spans some 
tributary of the Rhine forming the boundary between Alsace and 
Switzerland. When this bridge was being built, an almost insurmountable 
difficulty arose. Beelzebub, always willing to win a human soul, offered 
to aid the builders on condition that the first living being that crossed 
the bridge should be his, and he sent one of his imps to help.   
The bridge builder, being aware of the extreme gullibility of the fiend, 
consented, but outwitted him, for as soon as the bridge was completed, he 
brought a black goat, and placing it before him, pushed it across the 
bridge. Beelzebub's imp, in his rage at being outwitted, grasped the goat 
by the horns, and hurled it through the floor of the bridge.   
Every old Alsatian who comes from this part of Alsace will solemnly aver 
that the hole is still there, because all efforts at repairing the breach 
are frustrated by Beelzebub's imps.
