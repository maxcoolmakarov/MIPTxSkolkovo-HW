The best tool for Internet research is not a comprehensive list of 
favorite sites, but rather a repertory of a few efficient search engines 
and reliable indexes, together with a basic understanding of how to use 
them. The starting place for almost any Internet search is  Google .  
This site's use 
of keywords is simple and efficient. Word groups set off by quotation 
marks are treated as single units. Thus the search term  "fairy 
tales"  will find only web sites containing that phrase, but not the 
same words appearing separately. The keywords  "little mermaid" 
copenhagen  will find sites containing  Copenhagen  and  Little 
Mermaid  in any order, but  Little Mermaid  must appear as an 
unbroken phrase. Google, like most search engines, is not case sensitive; 
lower-case letters can substitute for upper-case ones, and vice versa.  

Although Google is very thorough, one can usually locate further sites by 
conducting the same search with additional engines. The following are 
proven performers:  
 
 Excite .  
 Lycos .  
 Teoma .  
 Webcrawler .  
 Yahoo! .
