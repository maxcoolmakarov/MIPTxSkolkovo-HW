Once there was a woman who did not want to do any spinning. Her husband 
often scolded her for not accomplishing anything. 
Saddened by this, she was walking along thinking about her situation when 
suddenly a dwarf appeared before her. He asked her 
what was wrong with her and if he could not help her. She told him 
everything, and the dwarf said that he would help her if she 
would give him what she was carrying under her apron. However, if she 
could guess his name then she would not need to give him anything.   
The woman did not think about this very long before saying yes, for she 
did not believe that she had anything under her apron. 
From that time onward she always had yarn enough, and every Saturday when 
her husband came to see what she had done, 
there was always an abundance. She was happy and satisfied, but before 
long all this changed, for she was about to deliver a 
child, and she now realized what the dwarf had meant.   
Filled with grief, she told her husband everything. One day when he was 
walking over a mountain he heard the humming of a 
spinning wheel from within the mountain, and a dwarf singing: 
 
 
 
  Dat is gaut dat de gnädige Frû nich weit  
dat ik Zirkzirk heit. 
   
 
  It is good that the honorable lady does not know   
that Zirkzirk is my name. 
 
 
 
 
He joyfully returned home and reported this to his wife. After she 
delivered her child the dwarf appeared to her, in order to 
collect that which had been promised to him. She told him what his name 
was, and he never again returned.
