A widow and her son, a little boy, lived together in a cottage in or near 
the village of Rothley, Northumberland. One winter evening, the child 
refused to go to bed with his mother, as he wished to sit up for a while 
longer, "for," said he "I am not sleepy."   
The mother, finding remonstrance in vain, at last told him that if he sat 
up by himself, the fairies would most certainly come and take him away. 
The boy laughed as his mother went to bed, leaving him sitting by the 
fire.   
He had not been there long, watching the fire and enjoying its cheerful 
warmth, till a beautiful little figure, about the size of a child's doll, 
descended the chimney, and alighted on the hearth! The little fellow was 
somewhat startled at first, but its prepossessing smile as it paced to and 
fro before him, soon overcame his fears, and he enquired familiarly "What 
do they ca' thou?"   
"Ainsel" answered the little thing haughtily, at the same time retorting 
the question, "And what do they ca'  thou? "   
" My  Ainsel," answered the boy; and they commenced playing together 
like two children newly acquainted. Their gambols continued quite 
innocently until the fire began to grow dim; the boy then took up the 
poker to stir it, when a hot cinder accidentally fell upon the foot of his 
playmate, her tiny voice was instantly raised to a most terrific roar, and 
the boy had scarcely time to crouch into the bed behind his mother, before 
the voice of the old fairy mother was heard shouting "Who's done it? Who's 
done it?"   
"Oh! It was My Ainsel!" answered the daughter.   
"Why then," said the mother, as she kicked her up the chimney, "What's all 
the noise for, there's nyen [no one] to blame."
