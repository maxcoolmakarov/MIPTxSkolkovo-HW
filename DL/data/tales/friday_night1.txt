The Hodja and his wife made an agreement to fulfill their marital 
duties every Friday night.  
"But with all my other obligations, how will I remember that it is Friday 
night?" asked Nasreddin.  
"Each week I shall place your turban on the large chest, so you will know 
that it is Friday," answered the wife.   
One night, not on a Friday, the wife desired to make love, so 
she placed Nasreddin's turban on the chest.   
The Hodja said, "But wife, this is not Friday night."   
She answered, "It is Friday night."   
He replied, "Wife, in this house either Friday shall wait for me, 
or I shall wait for Friday."
