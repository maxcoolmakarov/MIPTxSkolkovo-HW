A peasant in a village was wealthy in land and goods, but still rash and disagreeable. It was harvest time, and he should have had workers in his fields cutting the grain, but he did not want to give out the money for their pay. So it is with the wealthy: The more they have, the stingier they are. Thus he spent day and night worrying about how he could bring in his harvest without any cost to himself.  
While he was thus fretting, the devil appeared to him in the form of a man and asked him why he was so concerned. Would he be able to help?  
The peasant said, "Dear brother, I have a great harvest in my fields. It should be cut and brought into my barn, but I don't want to give out my money to the workers. If you have any advice for me, let me hear it."  
The devil said, "If you agree to be mine afterward, I shall bring all your grain into your barn."  
The sly peasant, thinking that he could outwit the devil, answered, "If you can do three things that I ask of you, then afterward I will go with you wherever you want."  
The devil agreed to this and asked what he should do.  
"Good," said the peasant. "First bring all my grain into the barn, without damaging any of it. And after you have done that, bring to my house all the wood that is lying about in the forest and in the meadows. When you have done all this, I'll tell you what else you have to do."  
The devil did not think that any of this would be difficult, and he completed these two tasks forthwith. He then returned to the peasant and asked what his last task was to be.  
Now early that morning the peasant had eaten raw turnips so that he would be able to fart mightily. Then he let a great fart and said to the devil, "Listen, brother, catch that and tie a knot in it!"  
The devil was unable to do this, so he went away and left the peasant sitting there by himself.
