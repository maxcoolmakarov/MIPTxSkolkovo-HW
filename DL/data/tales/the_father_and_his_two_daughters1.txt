A man who had two daughters married one to a gardener, the other to a 
potter. After awhile he paid a visit to the gardener's, and asked his 
daughter how she was and how it fared with her.   
"Excellently well," said she; "we have everything that we want; I have but 
one prayer, that we may have a heavy storm of rain to water our plants." 
 
Off he set to the potter's, and asked his other daughter how matters went 
with her.  
"There is not a thing we want," she replied; "and I only hope this fine 
weather and hot sun may continue, to bake our tiles."  
"Alack," said the father, "if you wish for fine weather, and your sister 
for rain, which am I to pray for myself?"
