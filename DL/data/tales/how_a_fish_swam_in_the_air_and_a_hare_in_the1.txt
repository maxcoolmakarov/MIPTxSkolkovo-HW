Water 
 
 Once upon a time an old man and his wife lived together in a little
village. They might have been happy if only the old woman had had the
sense to hold her tongue at proper times. But anything which might happen
indoors, or any bit of news which her husband might bring in when he had
been anywhere, had to be told at once to the whole village, and these
tales were repeated and altered until it often happened that much mischief
was made, and the old man's back paid for it. 
 One day, he drove to the forest. When he reached the edge of it he got
out of his cart and walked beside it. Suddenly he stepped on such a soft
spot that his foot sank in the earth. 
 "What can this be?" thought he. "I'll dig a bit and see." 
 So he dug and dug, and at last he came on a little pot full of gold and
silver. 
 "Oh, what luck! Now, if only I knew how I could take this treasure home
with me -- but I can never hope to hide it from my wife, and once she
knows of it she'll tell all the world, and then I shall get into
trouble." 
 He sat down and thought over the matter a long time, and at last he
made a plan. He covered up the pot again with earth and twigs, and drove
on into the town, where he bought a live pike and a live hare in the
market. Then he drove back to the forest and hung the pike up at the very
top of a tree, and tied up the hare in a fishing net and fastened it on
the edge of a little stream, not troubling himself to think how unpleasant
such a wet spot was likely to be to the hare. Then he got into his cart
and trotted merrily home. 
 "Wife!" cried he, the moment he got indoors. "You can't think what a
piece of good luck has come our way." 
 "What, what, dear husband? Do tell me all about it at once." 
 "No, no, you'll just go on and tell everyone." 
 "No, indeed! How can you think such things! For shame! If you like I
will swear never to -- " 
 "Oh, well! If you are really in earnest then, listen." 
 And he whispered in her ear, "I've found a pot full of gold and silver
in the forest! Hush! -- " 
 "And why didn't you bring it back?" 
 "Because we'll drive there together and bring it carefully back between
us." 
 So the man and his wife drove to the forest. As they were driving along
the man said, "What strange things one hears, wife! I was told only the
other day that fish will now live and thrive in the tree tops and that
some wild animals spend their time in the water. Well, well! Times are
certainly changed." 
 "Why, you must be crazy, husband! Dear, dear, what nonsense people do
talk sometimes." 
 "Nonsense, indeed! Why, just look. Bless my soul, if there isn't a
fish, a real pike I do believe, up in that tree." 
 "Gracious!" cried his wife. "How did a pike get there? It  is  a
pike -- you needn't attempt to say it's not. Can people have said true --
" 
 But the man only shook his head and shrugged his shoulders and opened
his mouth and gaped as if he really could not believe his own eyes. 
 "What are you standing staring at there, stupid?" said his wife. "Climb
up the tree quick and catch the pike, and we'll cook it for dinner." 
 The man climbed up the tree and brought down the pike, and they drove
on. When they got near the stream he drew up. 
 "What are you staring at again?" asked his wife impatiently. "Drive on,
can't you?" 
 "Why, I seem to see something moving in that net I set. I must just go
and see what it is." 
 He ran to it, and when he had looked in it he called to his wife, "Just
look! Here is actually a four-footed creature caught in the net. I do
believe it's a hare." 
 "Good heavens!" cried his wife. "How did the hare get into your net? It
 is  a hare, so you needn't say it isn't. After all, people must have
said the truth -- " 
 But her husband only shook his head and shrugged his shoulders as if he
could not believe his own eyes. 
 "Now what are you standing there for, stupid?" cried his wife. "Take up
the hare. A nice fat hare is a dinner for a feast day." 
 The old man caught up the hare, and they drove on to the place where
the treasure was buried. They swept the twigs away, dug up the earth, took
out the pot, and drove home again with it. And now the old couple had
plenty of money and were cheery and comfortable. But the wife was very
foolish. Every day she asked a lot of people to dinner and feasted them,
until her husband grew quite impatient. He tried to reason with her, but
she would not listen. 
 "You've got no right to lecture me!" said she. "We found the treasure
together, and together we will spend it." 
 Her husband took patience, but at length he said to her, "You may do as
you please, but I shan't give you another penny." 
 The old woman was very angry. "Oh, what a good-for-nothing fellow to
want to spend all the money himself! But just wait a bit and see what I
shall do." 
 Off she went to the governor to complain of her husband. 
 "Oh, my lord, protect me from my husband! Ever since he found the
treasure there is no bearing him. He only eats and drinks, and won't work,
and he keeps all the money to himself." 
 The governor took pity on the woman, and ordered his chief secretary to
look into the matter. The secretary called the elders of the village
together, and went with them to the man's house. 
 "The governor," said he, "desires you to give all that treasure you
found into my care." 
 The man shrugged his shoulders and said, "What treasure? I know nothing
about a treasure." 
 "How? You know nothing? Why your wife has complained of you. Don't
attempt to tell lies. If you don't hand over all the money at once you
will be tried for daring to raise treasure without giving due notice to
the governor about it." 
 "Pardon me, your excellency, but what sort of treasure was it supposed
to have been? My wife must have dreamt of it, and you gentlemen have
listened to her nonsense." 
 "Nonsense, indeed," broke in his wife. "A kettle full of gold and
silver, do you call that nonsense?" 
 "You are not in your right mind, dear wife. Sir, I beg your pardon. Ask
her how it all happened, and if she convinces you I'll pay for it with my
life." 
 "This is how it all happened, Mr. Secretary," cried the wife. "We were
driving through the forest, and we saw a pike up in the top of a tree --
" 
 "What, a  pike?"  shouted the secretary. "Do you think you may
joke with me, pray?" 
 "Indeed, I'm not joking, Mr. Secretary! I'm speaking the bare
truth." 
 "Now you see, gentlemen," said her husband, "how far you can trust her,
when she chatters like this." 
 "Chatter, indeed? I! Perhaps you have forgotten, too, how we found a
live hare in the river?" 
 Everyone roared with laughter; even the secretary smiled and stroked
his beard, and the man said, "Come, come, wife, everyone is laughing at
you. You see for yourself, gentlemen, how far you can believe her." 
 "Yes, indeed," said the village elders, "it is certainly the first time
we have heard that hares thrive in the water or fish among the tree
tops." 
 The secretary could make nothing of it all, and drove back to the town.
The old woman was so laughed at that she had to hold her tongue and obey
her husband ever after, and the man bought wares with part of the treasure
and moved into the town, where he opened a shop, and prospered, and spent
the rest of his days in peace.
