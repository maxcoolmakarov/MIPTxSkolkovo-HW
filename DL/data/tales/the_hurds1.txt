Once upon a time there was a girl who was beautiful, but lazy and
negligent. When she had to spin she was so ill tempered that if there was
a little knot in the flax, she at once pulled out a whole heap of it, and
scattered it about on the ground beside her. Now she had a servant who was
industrious, and who gathered together the discarded flax, cleaned it,
spun it well, and had a beautiful dress woven out of it for herself.  
 A young man had courted the lazy girl, and the wedding was about to
take place. On the eve of the wedding, the industrious girl was dancing
merrily about in her beautiful dress, and the bride said, 
 
 
 Ach, wat kann das MÃ¤ken springen 
in minen Slickerlingen! 
 
 Ah, how that girl can jump about, 
in my hurds! 
 
 
 
 The bridegroom heard this, and asked the bride what she meant by it. So
she told him that the girl was wearing a dress made from the flax which
she had thrown away. When the bridegroom heard this, and saw how lazy she
was, and how industrious the poor girl was, he gave her up and went to the
other girl, and chose her as his wife.
