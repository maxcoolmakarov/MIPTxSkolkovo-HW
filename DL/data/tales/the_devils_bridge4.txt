The Devil's Bridge is twelve miles from Aberystwyth; 
it is over the Afon Mynach just before its junction with 
the Rheidol. The Mynach cataract consists of four leaps, 
making a total descent of 210 feet. The bridge has been 
thrown across a chasm 114 feet above the first fall and 
324 feet above the bottom of the cataract. The original 
bridge was constructed by the monks of Strata Florida, at 
what time is unknown, but legend says it was built by the 
devil. 

 
Old Megan Llandunach, of Pont-y-Mynach,  
Had lost her only cow;  
Across the ravine the cow was seen.  
But to get it she could not tell how.
  

In this dilemma the Evil One appeared to her cowled as 
a monk, and with a rosary at his belt, and offered to cast 
a bridge across the chasm if she would promise him the 
first living being that should pass over it when complete. 
To this she gladly consented. The bridge was thrown 
across the ravine, and the Evil One stood beyond bowing 
and beckoning to the old woman to come over and try it. 
But she was too clever to do that She had noticed his 
left leg as he was engaged on the construction, and saw 
that the knee was behind in place of in front, and for a 
foot he had a hoof. 

  
In her pocket she fumbled, a crust out tumbled,  
She called her little black cur;  
The crust over she threw, the dog after it flew,  
Says she, "The dog's yours, crafty sir!"
