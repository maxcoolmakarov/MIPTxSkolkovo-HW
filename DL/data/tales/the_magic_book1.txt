It is said that eighteen years ago an old shepherd from Mödiskruge, County of Guben, possessed a book containing all kinds of secrets. He wanted to get rid of it and tried to cut it into pieces, burn it, and give it away, but nothing succeeded until the pastor in Fünfeichen took it from him in the church.  
Children were told to walk around the old man three time if they wanted to speak to him. Otherwise he could harm them, put a spell on them, or something similar.
