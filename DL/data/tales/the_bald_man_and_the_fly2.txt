There was once a bald man who sat down after work on a hot summer's day. A fly came up a kept buzzing about his bald pate, and stinging him from time to time.  
The man aimed a blow at his little enemy, but --  whack  -- his palm came on his head instead. Again the fly tormented him, but this time the man was wiser and said: " You will only injure youself if you take notice of despicable enemies. "
