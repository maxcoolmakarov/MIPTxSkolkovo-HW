As a  Wolfe  was Hunting up and down for his Supper, he pass'd by a Door where a Little Child was Bawling, and an Old Woman Chiding it.  Leave your Vixen-Tricks,   says the  Woman or I'l throw ye to the Wolfe.  The  Wolfe  Over-heard her, and Waited a pretty While, in hope the  Woman  would be as good as her Word; but No Child coming, away goes the  Wolfe  for That Bout. He took his Walk the Same Way again toward the Evening, and the Nurse he found had Chang'd her Note; for she was Then Muzzling, and Cokesing of it.  That's a Good Dear,  says she,  If the Wolf comes for My Child We'll e'en Beat his Brains out.  The  Wolf  went Muttering away upon't. There's No Meddling with People, says he, that say One Thing and Mean Another.  
 The MORAL 
 'Tis Fear more then Love that makes Good Men, as well as Good Children, and when Fair Words, and Good Councel will not Prevail upon us, we must be Frighted into our Duty. 
 REFLEXION 
THE Heart and Tongue of a Woman are commonly a Great way asunder. And it may bear Another Moral; which is, that 'tis with Froward Men, and Froward Factions too, as 'tis with Froward Children, They'll be sooner Quieted by Fear, and Rough Dealing, then by any Sense of Duty or Good Nature. There would be no Living in This World without  Penal Laws,   and  Conditions.  And  Do or Do not,  This or That at your Peril, is as Reasonable, and Necessary in Families as it is in Governments. It is a Truth Imprinted in the Hearts of All Mankind, that the  Gibbets, Pillories,  and the  Whipping-Posts  make more Converts then the  Pulpits : As the Child did more here for  fear  of the  Wolfe,  then for the  Love  of the  Nurse.
