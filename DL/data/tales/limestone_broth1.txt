The making of "limestone broth" was a device employed by wandering beggars 
to secure a good supper without seeming to ask for it. The beggar, making 
his way into one of the cabins which had always their doors hospitably 
open for poor vagrants would ask the  vanithee  (or woman of the 
house) to lend him a small pot, and allow him to cook his supper upon her 
fire. Permission was, of course, granted, and the pot was produced.   
He then took from his wallet two substantial pieces of freshly cut 
limestone, which he placed in the pot, and, covering them with water, put 
the pot upon the fire to boil.   
The  vanithee , looking on with interest, exclaimed, "What are yez 
goin' to make, me good man?"   
"Limestone broth, ma'am," replied the beggar.   
"Glory be to God, look at that now!" exclaimed the amazed housewife. When 
the boiling had proceeded for some time the beggar-man tasted the 
contents, and remarked "it would be grately improved by a pinch o' salt." 
  
The "pinch o' salt " was given him, and by-and-by he suggested that all 
the "broth" wanted was just a couple of spoonfuls of "male" to thicken it. 
Next came a request for a few slices of turnips, potatoes, and onions, to 
give it a little substance, all of which the good woman, who continued 
watching the proceedings with the keenest interest, kindly supplied; nor 
did she refuse "a knuckle of bacon," just to give the broth "the laste 
taste in the world of the flavour of mate."   
And when, at the conclusion of the operation, she was invited to try the 
"limestone broth," she pronounced it "quite as good as any mate broth she 
ever tasted in her life."
