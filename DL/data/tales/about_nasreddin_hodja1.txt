Nasreddin Hodja is Turkey's (and perhaps all of Islam's) best-known 
trickster. His legendary wit and droll trickery were possibly based on the 
exploits and words of a historical imam. Nasreddin reputedly was born in 
1208 in the village of Horto near Sivrihisar. In 1237 he moved to Aksehir, 
where he died in the Islamic year 683 (1284 or 1285). As many as 350 
anecdotes have been attributed to the Hodja, as he most often is called. 
Hodja is a title meaning teacher or scholar. He frequently is compared 
with the northern European trickster Till Eulenspiegel.
