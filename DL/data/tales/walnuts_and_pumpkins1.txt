Nasreddin Hodja was lying in the shade of an ancient walnut tree. His 
body was at rest, but, befitting his calling as an imam, his mind did not 
relax. Looking up into the mighty tree he considered the greatness and 
wisdom of Allah.  
"Allah is great and Allah is good," said the Hodja, "but was it indeed 
wise that such a great tree as this be created to bear only tiny walnuts 
as fruit? Behold the stout stem and strong limbs. They could easily carry 
the pumpkins that grow from spindly vines in yonder field, vines that 
cannot begin to bear the weight of their own fruit. Should not walnuts 
grow on weakly vines and pumpkins on sturdy trees?"  
 So thinking, the Hodja dosed off, only to be awakened by a walnut that 
fell from the tree, striking him on his forehead.  
 "Allah be praised!" he exclaimed, seeing what had happened. "If the 
world had been created according to my meager wisdom, it would have been a 
pumpkin that fell from the tree and hit me on the head. It would have 
killed me for sure! Allah is great! Allah is good! Allah is wise!"  
 Never again did Nasreddin Hodja question the wisdom of Allah.
