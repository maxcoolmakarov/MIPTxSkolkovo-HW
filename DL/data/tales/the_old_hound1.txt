A hound who had served his master well for years, and had run down many a 
quarry in his time, began to lose his strength and speed owing to age. One 
day, when out hunting, his master started a powerful wild boar and set the 
hound at him. The latter seized the beast by the ear, but his teeth were 
gone and he could not retain his hold; so the boar escaped. His master 
began to scold him severely, but the hound interrupted him with these 
words, "My will is as strong as ever, master, but my body is old and 
feeble. You ought to honor me for what I have been instead of abusing me 
for what I am."
