The Conan is as bonny a river as we hae in a' the north country. There 's 
mony a sweet sunny spot on its banks, an' mony a time an' aft hae I waded 
through its shallows, whan a boy, to set my little scautling-line for the 
trouts an' the eels, or to gather the big pearl-mussels that lie sae thick 
in the fords. But its bonny wooded banks are places for enjoying the day 
in -- no for passing the nicht. I kenna how it is; it 's nane o' your wild 
streams that wander desolate through a desert country, like the Aven, or 
that come rushing down in foam and thunder, ower broken rocks, like the 
Foyers, or that wallow in darkness, deep, deep in the bowels o' the earth, 
like the fearfu' Auldgraunt; an' yet no ane o' these rivers has mair or 
frightfuller stories connected wi' it than the Conan. Ane can hardly 
saunter ower half-a-mile in its course, frae where it leaves Coutin till 
where it enters the sea, without passing ower the scene o' some frightful 
auld legend o' the kelpie or the waterwraith.   
And ane o' the most frightful looking o' these places is to be found among 
the woods of Conan House. Ye enter a swampy meadow that waves wi' flags 
an' rushes like a corn-field in harvest, an' see a hillock covered wi' 
willows rising like an island in the midst. There are thick mirk-woods on 
ilka side; the river, dark an' awesome, an' whirling round an' round in 
mossy eddies, sweeps away behind it; an' there is an auld burying-ground, 
wi' the broken ruins o' an auld Papist kirk, on the tap. Ane can see amang 
the rougher stanes the rose-wrought mullions of an arched window, an' the 
trough that ance held the holy water. About twa hunder years ago -- a wee 
mair maybe, or a wee less, for ane canna be very sure o' the date o' thae 
old stories -- the building was entire; an' a spot near it, whar the wood 
now grows thickest, was laid out in a corn-field. The marks o' the furrows 
may still be seen amang the trees.   
A party o' Highlanders were busily engaged, ae day in harvest, in cutting 
down the corn o' that field; an' just aboot noon, when the sun shone 
brightest an' they were busiest in the work, they heard a voice frae the 
river exclaim, "The hour but not the man has come."   
Sure enough, on looking round, there was the kelpie stan'in' in what they 
ca' a fause ford, just foment the auld kirk. There is a deep black pool 
baith aboon an' below, but i' the ford there 's a bonny ripple, that 
shows, as ane might think, but little depth o' water; an' just i' the 
middle o' that, in a place where a horse might swim, stood the kelpie. An' 
it again repeated its words, "The hour but not the man has come," an' then 
flashing through the water like a drake, it disappeared in the lower pool. 
  
When the folk stood wondering what the creature might mean, they saw a man 
on horseback come spurring down the hill in hot haste, making straight for 
the fause ford. They could then understand her words at ance; an' four o' 
the stoutest o' them sprang oot frae amang the corn to warn him o' his 
danger, an' keep him back. An' sae they tauld him what they had seen an' 
heard, an' urged him either to turn back an' tak' anither road, or stay 
for an hour or sae where he was. But he just wadna hear them, for he was 
baith unbelieving an' in haste, an' wauld hae taen the ford for a' they 
could say, hadna the Highlanders, determined on saving him whether he 
would or no, gathered round him an' pulled him frae his horse, an' then, 
to mak' sure o' him, locked him up in the auld kirk.   
Weel, when the hour had gone by -- the fatal hour o' the kelpie -- they 
flung open the door, an' cried to him that he might noo gang on his 
journey. Ah ! but there was nae answer, though; an' sae they cried a 
second time, an' there was nae answer still; an' then they went in, an' 
found him lying stiff an' cauld on the floor, wi' his face buried in the 
water o' the very stone trough that we may still see amang the ruins. His 
hour had come, an' he had fallen in a fit, as 'twould seem, head-foremost 
amang the water o' the trough, where he had been smothered, -- an' sae ye 
see, the prophecy o' the kelpie availed naething.
