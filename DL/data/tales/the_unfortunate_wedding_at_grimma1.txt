On the 16th of October in the year 1637 a respected and educated man from Grimma gave his daughter in marriage to the rector of the Grimma school. A number of students from Leipzig were present at the wedding. One of them made up a very indecent wedding-poem and presented it to the guests. In this poem he included a disgraceful parody of the Christian burial hymn "Now Let Us Bury the Corpse," which he sang with the words:  
 
 
 
Nun lasset uns die Braut begraben,  
Und gar keine Zweifel haben,  
Daß Morgen sie wird auferstehen,  
Und auf zwei Weiberfüssen gehn.
 
 
Now let us bury the bride,  
And we have no doubt at all,  
Tomorrow she shall rise again,  
But no longer as a maid.  
 
 
 
 
What happened next? They laughed about the burial hymn, but on the third day after the wedding the bride died from the plague. A few days later the bridegroom died as well, as well as two of the bride's brothers, who were students. They went, as it states in the chronical:  a thalamo ad tumulum, a luxu ad luctum  [from the bridal chamber to the grave, from celebration to sorrow].
