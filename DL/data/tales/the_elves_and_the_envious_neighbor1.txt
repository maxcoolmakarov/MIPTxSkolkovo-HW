Once upon a time there was a certain man, who, being overtaken by darkness 
among the mountains, was driven to seek shelter in the trunk of a hollow 
tree. In the middle of the night, a large company of elves assembled at 
the place; and the man, peeping out from his hiding place, was frightened 
out of his wits. After a while, however, the elves began to feast and 
drink wine, and to amuse themselves by singing and dancing, until at last 
the man, caught by the infection of the fun, forgot all about his fright, 
and crept out of his hollow tree to join in the revels.   
When the day was about to dawn, the elves said to the man, "You're a very 
jolly companion, and must come out and have a dance with us again. You 
must make us a promise, and keep it."   
So the elves, thinking to bind the man over to return, took a large wen 
that grew on his forehead and kept it in pawn; upon this they all left the 
place, and went home.   
The man walked off to his own house in high glee at having passed a jovial 
night, and got rid of his wen into the bargain. So he told the story to 
all his friends, who congratulated him warmly on being cured of his wen. 
But there was a neighbor of his who was also troubled with a wen of long 
standing, and, when he heard of his friend's luck, he was smitten with 
envy, and went off to hunt for the hollow tree, in which, when he had 
found it, he passed the night.   
Elves, mistaking him for their former boon-companion, were delighted to 
see him, and said, "You're a good fellow to recollect your promise, and 
we'll give you back your pledge."   
So one of the elves, pulling the pawned wen out of his pocket, stuck it 
onto the man's forehead, on the top of the other wen which he already had. 
So the envious neighbor went home weeping, with two wens instead of one. 
  
This is a good lesson to people who cannot see the good luck of others, 
without coveting it for themselves.
