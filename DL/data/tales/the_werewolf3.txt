The Hessian farmer knows and fears the ravenous werewolf even today
[1854]. 
This is a human whose shape has been transformed by putting on a belt.
The
werewolf attacks everything that gets in his way, and is especially
dangerous
for the herds.  However, there is a way to destroy the belt's magic power:
If
one throws a knife -- a piece of shiny steel -- over the werewolf, he will
instantly be transformed into his true human form and stand there
completely
naked. 
In the vicinity of Wolfhagen there was a well-to-do woman of good
parentage who
almost every night would leave her house and roam the fields as a
werewolf. 
Once a shepherd bravely approached the werewolf, as it crept into an alder
thicket, its appetite sated.  The shepherd, who had long pursued the
werewolf,
hoped to capture it.  He threw his pocketknife over its head and neck, and
immediately the woman was standing naked there before him.  She implored
him to
have mercy with her and to not tell the story to anyone.  The shepherd was
highly surprised to see the well known woman before him, and he promised
to keep
the event a secret.  Nonetheless, within a few days everyone knew about
it.
