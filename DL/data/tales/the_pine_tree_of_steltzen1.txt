Steltzen is the name of a village that belongs to the Voigtsberg municipality. A peasant from there once dreamed that he should travel to Regensburg where he would get rich on the bridge. The man got up, took a bag with some provisions of bread and butter, but very little money because he was poor. He went to Regensburg and walked back and forth on the bridge for a few days, but no wealth was to be seen. He continuously looked on the ground for a bag of money, but in vain. He looked at everyone with sad eyes and finally decided to return home. 
However, before leaving he met a man on the bridge who asked him what his problems were. The peasant told him about his dream and his great poverty and how he had scarcely but one  Kreutzer  to get home with.  
The man from Regensburg told him that he had acted foolishly by going so far because of a mere dream. He then told him how he himself had dreamed, that he should go to Steltzen in Voigtland where he would see a big pine tree just outside of the village. If he would  dig under it he would find lots of money. He added that if he had gone there he would have had the same bad luck. Then out of pity he gave the peasant a gulden for pocket-money on his return trip.  
The peasant was glad for this information, because the pine tree was on his own land, and he thought long and hard about what that man had said.  
He arrived home empty handed.  His wife looked at him with angry eyes, but he paid no attention to her. Without saying anything to anyone, he took a hoe and a shovel and went to the tree. To his good luck in a short time he found a copper kettle filled with fine old money. He put as much into his pockets as they would hold and then filled back the hole in the ground. He returned to his wife, and the two of them then went back and took the rest of the money.   
The pine tree was still standing until recent times and was so well shaped and tall that it could be seen from a distance of five miles.
