In old times it was the habit to kill old men when they had passed
fifty years. A man who was nearing his fiftieth year had a good son, who
was very sorry for his father and hid him in a wine vat, in which he cared
for him secretly. 
 
Once he bet with some of his neighbors who should see
the first rising of the sun in the morning. The merciful son told his
father of his bet, and his father said to him, "Be careful, and when you
are at the place to see the rising of the sun take, the precaution not to
look to the east as the others will do, but look instead to the west at
the highest point of the mountains, and you will win the bet." 
 The son did as his father had advised him, and so saw first the rising
of the sun. When the neighbors asked him who had advised him what to do,
he said it was his father, whom he must hide and protect from a forced
death. The people were astonished at such clever advice and concluded that
the old men are clever and that they do not deserve to be killed, but
respected.
