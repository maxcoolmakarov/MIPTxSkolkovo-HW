In the vicinity of the main road between Neubrandenburg and 
Stavenhagen, adjacent to the field belonging to Gevezin and Blankenhof, 
there are three hills: Blocksberg, Jabsberg, and Lindberg.   
A long time ago lindorms lived there. When they lay outstretched, they 
resembled a felled fir tree, and they were feared far and wide.   
Once a wagon was driving along the road, and not far from the watermill it 
came to a young lindorm lying across the road asleep in the sun. Thinking 
that it was a fir log, the driver drove over it. Only after the run-over 
beast cried out did the driver realize what it was, and he drove away.   
Hearing the cry, the old lindorm rushed forward and found its young one 
dead. Enraged, it attacked a wagon loaded with straw headed in the 
direction of Neubrandenburg. The driver saw it and fled in a gallop. 
Fortunately, on  the far side of the Neuendorf Enclosure he lost his 
connecting pin, leaving the rear part of the wagon behind with its load of 
straw, while the driver hurried away all the faster on the front part of 
the wagon.   
The lindorm tore about in the straw, but finding no one there, it 
continued in pursuit of the driver. In order to gain speed, it bit into 
its tail, then rolled along after the wagon like a hoop. The driver just 
barely made it to the Brandenburg gate, which was quickly closed behind 
him, with the lindorm on the outside.   
The lindorm remained lying just outside the gate, there where Saint 
George's Church now stands, and no one from Brandenburg dared to go 
through the gate.   
Now a foreign prince by the name of George was in the city, and he made 
the decision to challenge the lindorm. After a difficult battle he 
succeeded in cutting off the beast's tail, which was the source of its 
strength, and then he quickly killed it.   
In commemoration of this event Saint George's Church was built, and the 
story is depicted on its altar.
