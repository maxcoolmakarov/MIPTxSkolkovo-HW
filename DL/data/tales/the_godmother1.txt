Two girls, all dressed up, were walking along playfully and
mischievously one evening when suddenly a gigantic fat toad waddled across
their path. The girls joked about the large animal: One of them said that
if it ever had a baby, she would be its godmother. The other one quickly
added that she would cook for the occasion. 
 A few days afterward, late in the evening, an old woman knocked at the
cottage door of the two girls, reminded them of their promise, and asked
them to come to the baptism of the toad's child. They hesitated a long
time, but fear finally drove the mischievous pair out into the night and
the fog. The old woman led them to a remote place where the ceremony was
taking place. A woman was there with a newborn child, and surrounded by
all kinds of strange and unusual guests. Sighing, the two girls did what
they had promised to do. As they were discharged from their duties, the
woman thanked them kindly and gave them an apron filled with coal from the
fireplace. The girls did not dare to throw the unwanted gift away, but as
they quickly made their way homeward, they let most of the coal fall to
the ground, paying no attention to a voice that repeatedly sounded from
behind: 
 The more you throw away, 
The less you will have! 
 When they arrived at home, the little bit of coal that they still had
was nothing but pure gold.
