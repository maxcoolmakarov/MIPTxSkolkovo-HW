Mr. Halliwell gives us, in his  Popular Rhymes and Nursery Tales , 
the story of Teeny-Tiny. In this a little old woman takes a bone from the 
churchyard to make soup. She goes to bed, and puts the bone in the 
cupboard. During the night someone comes demanding the bone, and at length 
the terrified old woman gives it up.  
A similar story is told in Cornwall.   
An old lady had been to the church 
in the sands of Perranzabuloe. She
found, amidst the numerous remains of mortality, some very good teeth. She
pocketed these, and at night placed them on her dressing table before
getting into bed. She slept, but was at length disturbed by someone
calling out, "Give me my teeth. Give me my teeth." 
 At first, the lady took no notice of this, but the cry, "Give me my
teeth," was so constantly repeated, that she, at last, in terror, jumped
out of bed, took the teeth from the dressing table, and, opening the
window, flung them out, exclaiming, "Drat the teeth, take 'em!" 
 They no sooner fell into the darkness on the road than hasty retreating
footsteps were heard, and there were no more demands for the teeth.
