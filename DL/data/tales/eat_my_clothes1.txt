As Giufà was half a simpleton no one showed him any kindness,
such as to invite him to his house or give him anything to eat. Once
Giufà went to a farmhouse for something, and the farmers, when they
saw him looking so ragged and poor, came near setting the dogs on him, and
made him leave in a hurry. 
 When his mother heard it she procured for him a fine coat, a pair of
breeches, and a velvet vest. 
 Giufà dressed up like an overseer, went to the same farmhouse,
and then you should see what great ceremonies they made! They invited him
to dine with them. While at the table all were very attentive to him.
Giufà, on the one hand, filled his stomach, and on the other, put
into the pockets, coat, and hat whatever was left over, saying: "Eat, my
clothes, for you were invited!"
