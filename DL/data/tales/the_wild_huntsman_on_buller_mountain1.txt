In the Skrzynka Woods, which are part of Wyrth Forest in the Stargardt 
region, there is a high mountain named Buller Mountain.  The Wild 
Huntsman frequents this mountain on St. Bartholomew's Night [August 24].  
Many people have experienced how he rides through the woods with a 
frightful clamor. 
One time the head forester of the district was passing through these 
woods on this night, and he heard the noise.  In the belief that he was 
pursuing some poachers, he followed the sound.  Although he exerted 
himself to the utmost, he was unable to overtake the huntsmen, and he 
uttered a blasphemous curse.  Suddenly there was a frightful commotion 
above his head.  He heard the words "Here is something for you from our 
hunt!" and a human leg was thrown into his carriage.
