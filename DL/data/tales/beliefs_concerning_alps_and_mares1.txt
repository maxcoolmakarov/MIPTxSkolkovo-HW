It is believed that by stopping up the keyhole, placing one's shoes
with the toes facing the door, and then getting into bed backwards one can
protect oneself against nightmares or "Mortriden." [mare rides]. 
 Further, one can put something made from steel, for example an old
pair of scissors, in one's bed straw. 
 A person suffering from nightmares should urinate into a clean, new
bottle, hang the bottle in the sun for three days, carry it -- without
saying a word -- to a running stream, and then throw it over one's head
into the stream.
