A grown man mistreated his aged and sickly father so much that the latter asked to be put into a local pauper's hospice. There he hoped for at least a little care and to be spared the scorn from his son that was now so plaguing his life. The ungrateful son was only too happy to hear this, and before sundown the old man's wish had been fulfilled.  
However, not everything in the hospice met the old man's hopes. He asked his son, at the very least, to send him a pair of sheets so he would not have to sleep on bare straw. The son sought out the worst ones he had then told his ten-year old son to take them to the old grumble-head in the hospice.  
To his surprise he observed that his son hid one of the sheets in a corner then took just one of them to the grandfather.  
When the boy returned his father asked, "Why did you do that?"  
"I'm preparing for the future," replied the boy coldly, "when I send  you  to the hospice."  
What do we learn from this? -- Honor your father and mother, so that later you yourself will be well treated.
