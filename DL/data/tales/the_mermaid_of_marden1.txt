In former times Marden Church stood close to the river, and by some mischance one of the bells was allowed to fall into it.  It was immediately seized by a mermaid, who carried it to the bottom and held it there so fast that any number of horses could not move it.  
The people of the parish were told how to recover it, by wise men, according to some; others say the bell itself gave directions from the bottom of the river. A team of twelve white freemartins, i.e., heifers, was to be obtained and attached to the bell with yokes of the sacred yew tree, and bands of "wittern," or, in some versions, the drivers' goads were to be of witty or wittern (mountain ash).  
The bell was to be drawn out in perfect silence; it was successfully raised to the edge of the river with the mermaid inside fast asleep.  
In his excitement a driver, forgetting that silence was all-important, called out: 
 
In spite of all the devils in hell,  
Now we'll land Marden's great bell.  
 

This woke the mermaid, who darted back into the river, taking the bell with her, ringing: 
 
If it had not been  
For your wittern bands (or witty goads),  
And your yew tree pin,  
I'd have had your twelve freemartins in.  
 
So Marden folks have never had their bell back from the bottom of the river to this day, and sometimes it may still be heard ringing, echoing the bells of the church. It lies in a deep clear pool.
