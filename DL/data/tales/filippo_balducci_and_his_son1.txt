When Filippo Balducci lost his wife to death, he resolved to devote
himself and his young son to God. Consequently he gave his worldly
possessions to charity, then took his little son to the slopes of Mount
Asinaio, where they lived together in a cave, completely secluded from the
ways and temptations of the world. In this remote sanctuary, Filippo
taught his son about God and the saints, protecting him always from
distractions and sin.  
 Only after the boy reached the age of eighteen did the father feel it
safe to expose him to the outside world. 
 "Surely," thought Filippo, "his years of devotion and prayer in this
place of solitude will now defend him against the ways of the world." And
the two of them, father and son, set off for the city of Florence. 
 Everything was new and amazing for the son: houses, palaces, churches,
horses, and people. Filled with amazement, he asked his father about every
unfamiliar thing, and Filippo dutifully provided names and explanations
for all that they saw, that is, until they happened upon a party of
beautiful young women. The boy, who until now had never beheld such a
sight, could not take his eyes from them. 
 "Do not look at them," warned Filippo. 
 "But what are they?" asked the son. 
 "Oh, they are just geese," replied Filippo, wanting to divert the boy's
attention from the young women. 
 "Please, father," begged the boy, "let me have one of those geese. I
could put something into its bill. 
 "No!" exclaimed the father. "Their bills are not where you think they
are, and they require special feeding. And furthermore they are evil!" 
 Poor Filippo now regretted having taken his son from his protective
sanctuary, for even as he spoke, he realized that however clever his
responses were, they were no match for the boy's natural inclinations.
