They tell the story in Iserlohn that once a mine-dwarf (Bergmännchen) 
helped a spinning girl do her work in the most 
miraculous manner, in return for which he demanded the young girl's hand 
in marriage. The girl agreed to this proposal, thinking 
that he was not serious.   
One evening she called out to her fiancé, who had just arrived, 
"Look, is your name not Hoppetînken."   
Turning red with anger, the dwarf said, "The devil told you that."   
From that time onward he abandoned the spinning girl, and never again 
helped her.
