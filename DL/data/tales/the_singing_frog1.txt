There was once a priest who had two daughters. They went out into service, and the one became a servant at the king's castle. One day they went with each other down to the beach to bathe. There they heard someone singing beautifully. The sister who was the king's servant wished she could have a husband who could sing so beautifully.  
Then a frog jumped out of the water onto her lap and said, "Do you want me for your husband?"   
She answered no.  
When he asked the same thing again, her sister told her that she could make the promise, for it would not mean anything. She therefore answered yes when the frog asked the third time if she wanted him for a husband.  
The girl then went back to the king's castle. The frog jumped along after her. When she went inside and slammed the door in front of him, he sang:  
 
Open the door for me, my sweet little woman,  
For the sake of your rose-colored blood!  
Do you remember what you promised me  
At the beach when you were bathing?  
 
She would not open the door. 
Then the king came by and asked why she did not open the door. The girl said it that was only a frog who was not worth opening the door for.  
The king said that she should open the door. She then opened it, and the frog jumped in, singing:  
 
Pull up a chair for me, my sweet little woman,  
For the sake of your rose-colored blood!  
Do you remember what you promised me  
At the beach when you were bathing?  
 
The girl did not want to do this, and she said that it was a strange thing to offer a chair to such a slimy thing; but the king said she should do so, and then he himself pulled up a chair.  
The girl put the chair in front of the frog. He jumped up and sat down; then he sang:  
 
Spread a tablecloth for me, my sweet little woman,  
For the sake of your rose-colored blood!  
Do you remember what you promised me  
At the beach when you were bathing?  
 
At first the girl did not want to do this. Then the king said that she should do so, and he himself brought forth a tablecloth.  
She spread tablecloth before the frog, and he sang:  
 
Put food on it for me, my sweet little woman  
For the sake of your rose-colored blood!  
Do you remember what you promised me  
At the beach when you were bathing?  
 
The girl again objected; but the king said that she should do so. He himself brought forth some food, and the girl placed it before the frog.    
Then the frog sang:  
 
Bring me some beer, my sweet little woman,  
 For the sake of your rose-colored blood!  
Do you remember what you promised me  
At the beach when you were bathing?  
 
Beer was brought to him, and after he had eaten and drunk, he sang:
  
Make a bed for me, my sweet little woman,   
 For the sake of your rose-colored blood!   
Do you remember what you promised me   
At the beach when you were bathing?  
 
The girl thought that it would not be right to make a bed for such a wet, slimy thing. But the king said that she should not refuse, and he himself brought in the bedding. After the girl had had made the bed, the frog sang:  
 
Pull up a chair for me, my sweet little woman,   
 For the sake of your rose-colored blood!   
Do you remember what you promised me   
At the beach when you were bathing?  
 
The frog could not jump up into bed without first jumping up onto the chair. Once in bed he sang:  
 
Come to bed with me, my sweet little woman,   
For the sake of your rose-colored blood!   
Do you remember what you promised me   
At the beach when you were bathing?  
 
The girl was angry and did not want to do this, but the king told her to do so. She did not dare to lie alone with the frog, but she could take her boyfriend Per the servant with her.  
Once the frog was in bed with her, he asked her to poke three holes into his right front leg with a needle and thus draw three drops of blood. The girl did this, and the frog was transformed into a handsome prince. The frog-skin flew up through the chimney.  
It turned out that the frog was the king's son who had been bewitched many years ago. The prince then married the girl and became king after his father. In compensation Per the servant was awarded a principality, because he had to give up his girlfriend to the prince.
