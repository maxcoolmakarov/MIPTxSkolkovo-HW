An old man cut himself a bundle of sticks in a wood and started to carry 
them home. He had a long way to go, and was 

tired out before he had got much more than halfway. Casting his burden on 
the ground, he called upon Death to come and 

release him from his life of toil. The words were scarcely out of his 
mouth when, much to his dismay, Death stood 

before him and professed his readiness to serve him. He was almost 
frightened out of his wits, but he had enough 

presence of mind to stammer out, "Good sir, if you'd be so kind, pray help 
me up with my burden again."
