THE TRAVELLING SCHOLAR FROM PARADISE 
[October 8, 1550] 
THE PERSONS. 
The Travelling Scholar. 
The Farmer. 
The Farmer's Wife. 
 Wife   
My breath is burdened with my sighs,  
While thoughts of bygone days arise  
When my first husband lived.  
Ah me, He loved me dearly, tenderly.  
As I loved him! He was most kind.  
Honest in thought, and calm in mind:  
With him the gladness of my life  
Died out though I became a wife  
Again, and try, through weary days,  
To love my man. Alas, always  
Remembrance comes to mar my plan!  
He is not like my first good man:  
This one is parsimonious, stern.  
Anxious more money still to earn;  
He would be rich; for mirth cares not --  
Alas, how weary is my lot.  
Thinking of him now lost to me!  
Would I could show my memory  
To him, who made me laugh and sing!  
Oh, I would give him everything!  
[The Travelling Scholar comes.]  
 Scholar   
Dear mother, pray may I come in?  
I would thy commendation win.  
Thy charitable hand and alms;  
I have much skill and many charms  
From books, and Venus' mountain know.  
Where I have Cupids seen, and so  
Can tell of marvels. Now I go  
Throughout the land, and to and fro;  
A traveller upon my way  
From Paris, here I may not stay -- 
 Wife   
Dear sir! Dear sir! What dost thou say?  
From Paradise thou cam'st? I pray,  
Dear sir, thou wilt to me declare  
If thou didst see my husband there?  
He died -- O God, why was it so --  
To my sore grief, a year ago. 
 He was so honest, gentle, wise,  
I hope that he found Paradise.  
 Scholar   
There were so many fair souls there! --  
Tell me, what garments did he wear  
When he passed to eternity?  
And this may stir my memory.  
 Wife   
Easy it is to tell thee this --  
I hope that he is now in bliss! --  
He wore a blue hat, and his dress  
A winding sheet, no more, nor less:  
The winding sheet was not so bad;  
I wish he had been better clad.  
 Scholar   
Oh, my good dame, yes: that blue hat!  
How well do I remember that!  
No trowsers, shirt, nor shoes, he had;  
Just in his grave-cloth; it was sad:  
Howe'er he might that blue hat cock.  
And wrap his sheet, it was a mock.  
When others ate he could not join --   
He had no heller, not a coin --  
He looked at them with longing face.  
And lingered much about the place;  
Unless an alms some good soul gives  
The Lord alone knows how he lives!  
Good dame, it grieves me much to say  
He is in such a wretched wav.  
 Wife   
Dear husband! What hard fate he hath.  
Not e'en a pfennig for a bath!  
How pitiful! What grief to me  
He in such poverty should be!  
Tell me, dear sir, more thanks to earn,  
Dost thou to Paradise return?  
 Scholar   
Tomorrow I set forth, and fare  
For fourteen days, to bring me there.  
 Wife   
Wilt thou a bundle from me bear,  
For my dear husband, with all care?  
 Scholar   
Gladly will I; but do not waste  
My time; I am in utmost haste.  
 Wife   
Dear sir, have patience: I will be  
But a short time while hurriedly  
I gather up such things as he  
May use in his necessity. 
 [The Wife goes out.]  
 Scholar   
She is a simple soul, and kind --  
Too good to cheat -- but I must find  
Money and clothing, which I need;  
Then I will go away with speed  
Before her husband comes; for he  
May lack his wife's simplicity;  
So would he spoil the thing for me;  
Therefore I go while yet I can  
Become the heir of this dead man.  
[The Wife brings in a bundle.]  
 Wife   
Good messenger, I beg of thee,  
Take these twelve gulden now from me --  
This money so long hid away,  
My little all, for a dark day --  
Take it, dear sir, to him, I pray.  
With this my hoard I gladly part  
To the true husband of my heart;  
The bundle, too, I pray thee, take  
To my dear husband for his sake:  
Therein are blue cloth, hose and shoes;  
The cloth he surely there can use  
For coat and trowsers: and, with these,  
Pocket and pocket-knife will please.  
Tell him, the next time I will try  
To send him a more full supply;  
For I will save up all I can.  
Thinking of him, my dear, good man.  
Now go at once, that sooner he  
May be relieved from poverty.  
[The Travelling Scholar takes up the bundle.]  
 Scholar   
How will thy husband gaily think.  
When, on a feast-day, he will drink  
With friends his quart, how dear is she  
Who sends this cheer and revelry!  
 Wife   
How long, dear messenger, I pray,  
Will be the time thou art away?  
 Scholar   
It may be long: it cannot be  
That I shall come quite speedily.  
 Wife   
Alas! if very long away  
His money will be spent: no play,  
Nor food, nor drink, nor bath! Alas,  
That this too soon may come to pass!  
This groschen is my last; take it;  
I have no more of coin, nor wit.  
When threshing time is o'er I can  
Steal some odd coins from my good man,  
And bury them, as once before.  
Just at inside of stable door;  
There they are safe -- my gulden fair  
I kept for months in safety there --  
Accept this thaler for thy pay:  
Say greetings to my good man, pray!  
[The Travelling Scholar goes out.]  
Wife (singing)  
 Peasant maiden, Love is bright;  
He may come to thee, tonight.  
Peasant maiden. Love is sweet;  
He may kneel before thy feet.  
Peasant wife, put Love away;  
He cares not for thee today.  
 Farmer   
Dame, thou art merry: pray thee tell  
What is it pleaseth thee so well?  
 Wife   
Dear husband, O rejoice with me!  
I tell my happiness to thee:  
 Farmer   
Who hit this fool-calf in the eye?   
  [A common inquiry among the peasantry, in the time of this drama, when one appeared unaccountably excited.]  
 Wife   
It is a marvel! Passing by,  
A scholar stopped and spoke with me:  
From Paradise quite recently  
He wandered hither; and he told  
Of my first husband, poor and old:  
He only has his old blue hat  
And winding sheet. Oh, think of that!  
He hath no money, coat, nor shoes;  
No hose, nor anything to use  
Save hat and sheet -- no, nothing save  
What he took with him to the grave.  
 Farmer   
Wilt thou not send him something fit?  
 Wife   
Dear husband, yes; I thought of it:  
I sent our blue cloth, shirt and hose,  
 And breeches. He doth need the clothes.  
I sent a gulden, too, that he  
Might not without a groschen be.  
 Farmer   
Thou hast done well. But which way went  
The man by whom thy gifts were sent?  
 Wife   
He went by the Low Road, and bore  
The bundle on his back. He wore  
Around his neck a yellow net.  
 Farmer   
Yes, wife; and I will find him yet;  
Thou hast done well to give the stuff;  
But, of the money, not enough --  
Not near enough; it will not last.  
Have my horse saddled to go fast.  
And I will ride the Low Road o'er.  
And give the man ten gulden more.  
 Wife   
Before all things do I thank thee.  
That thou art now so good to me  
And my old husband. Tenderly  
I will deserve this love. Indeed  
All of my savings, in thy need, I'll give --  
 Farmer   
Cease babbling now to me!  
Have my horse saddled instantly,  
Or, in the fen-land, he will be  
Forever lost to me and thee.  
[The Wife goes out.]  
 Farmer   
Ach Gott, how weak a wife have I!  
That she is fair none will deny;  
She cooks a sausage, cleans a dish,  
But, in her mind, is a stock-fish:  
Half fool! yes; more a fool than any  
Fools of our parish, who are many.  
She sends her husband, dead a year,  
Money and clothes, and hath no fear  
The scholar hath deceived her. Ah!  
To catch the rogue will I ride far;  
Then I will beat the rascal well,  
So each big bruise will surely tell  
That Paradise he hath not found;  
Then, while he grovels on the ground,  
Money and clothes will I retake,  
And bear them home. For safety's sake  
My wife must feel my fists; if she  
Have black eyes, to remember me  
And her own folly, it may be  
A lesson. Through her foolishness  
My fortune must grow less and less.  
Alas, that I, to please my eyes,  
Married this useless, comely prize!  
I shall repent me all my days:  
If she had shrewd though drunken ways,  
So were she better, and might be  
More of a helpmate unto me. 
 [The Wife comes in.]  
 Wife   
The horse is ready: mount! away!  
And God go with thee through the day!  
[The Farmer and his Wife go out ; the Travelling Scholar comes in with his pack.]  
 Scholar   
How Fortune bids my star arise!  
Puts in my hand unlooked-for prize!  
Now I can live the winter through --  
And there are other women, too.  
Foolish as this, who will as well 
 Believe each tale that I may tell --  
Others, like this, not over-wise.  
Who will send me to Paradise --  
Odd-bobs! Here comes one riding fast;  
Behind the hedge my pack I cast;  
I doubt not this good man would take  
Bundle and coin for his wife's sake;  
He may not promptly be deceived;  
Nor his wife's Paradise believed.  
He cannot ride across the moor;  
The fen-land swamp would bog him sore --  
Ah! he dismounts. I put away  
My net; and wait what he may say.  
Leaning on my poor stick, who can  
Suspect I am no peasant man?  
[The Farmer comes in with spurs on.]  
 Farmer   
Good luck, my man! In this wild waste  
Hast seen one running in hot haste,  
With yellow neck-net? On his back  
A bundle blue, Uke peddler's pack ?  
 Scholar   
Oh, yes ; I saw him passing here;  
He crossed the moor like hunted deer;  
Across the moor, and to the wood;  
A moment, resting there, he stood;  
Through these scrub bushes went his track;  
He had a bundle on his back;  
Weary he seemed as on he ran;  
You quickly may o'ertake the man.  
 Farmer   
Upon my oath, it must be he!  
Good fellow, hold my horse for me;  
Through this soft moss I needs must run.  
To catch this crafty, thievish one;  
Then will I beat him black and blue --  
A beating that he long shall rue. 
 If he live long, which much I doubt.  
Hold fast the horse till I come out.  
 Scholar   
I wait a priest, and so shall stay  
Until he soon may pass this way;  
I gladly hold your horse's rein  
If you will soon be back again.  
 Farmer   
Earn thus a kreuzer. I am strong:  
Catching this thief will not take long.  
 Scholar   
Go swiftly on, the moor across;  
And have no fear about your horse.  
[The Farmer goes out]  
Welcome is this fine horse to me:  
Fair Fortune smiles most graciously.  
And brings good luck still in my way;  
This is, indeed, my lucky day!  
The simple wife gave clothes and gold;  
Her husband gives his horse -- to hold;  
Which I will do: I need not walk;  
The man is kind, for all his talk:  
He sees I am a lazy man.  
And so he helps me all he can.  
The bog is dangerous and deep,  
And the safe pathway hard to keep;  
Unless he choose his footsteps nice  
He will be first in Paradise;  
For should he here a misstep make  
It were the last that he would take.  
Now I will strap my pack across  
The back of this convenient horse;  
I care not here to make long stay;  
But speedily will ride away.  
This husband will have searched in vain,  
And soon, perchance, be back again;  
He might be in such surly mood.  
My acts would be misunderstood;  
So, laden with my good supplies,  
I spur away to Paradise.  
While he still seeks his horse to win,  
I eat my roast fowl at an inn.  
[The Travelling Student rides off with his pack. The Wife comes in.]  
 Wife   
It is a lonesome time today!  
Oh wherefore doth my husband stay!  
I fear that he has lost his way  
In bogs, so my old husband may  
Suffer in want from long delay --  
I hear the evening pipe's loud blast;  
And home the pigs are running fast.  
[The Wife goes out, and the Farmer comes in and looks around.]  
 Farmer   
Odds-bobs! Where is my horse? Not here?  
What a wise man am I! 'Tis clear:  
The rascal that deceived my wife  
Has now my horse. Upon my life,  
He has our money, clothes and horse,  
And I am left with triple loss!  
To trust that lying rogue, am I  
The biggest fool beneath the sky!  
Here comes my wife, and looks for me;  
I dare not tell this history:  
I threatened her with beating sore;  
Now I deserve that beating more;  
She lost the clothes -- small loss indeed --   
But I have lost my good grey steed.  
She to no stratagems was schooled.  
While I suspected, yet was fooled.  
When I have thought a fool was she,  
I wise, it seems two fools are we.  
[The Wife comes in.]  
 Wife   
On foot? Then thy good horse is sold.  
Found'st thou the man? and gav'st the gold?  
 Farmer   
He said the way was very long,  
And he was weary, and not strong:  
So I gave up my horse that he  
In Paradise might sooner be:  
Thus will thy husband have our help  
And my good horse to ride, himself.  
Say, wife, have I in this done right?  
I sought to help thy man's sad plight.  
 Wife   
Indeed thou hast. My husband, dear,  
I have not rightly known, I fear.  
Thy faithful heart. I do not jest:  
If thou wert dead, indeed my best  
I then would do to send to thee  
In Paradise, that thou might'st be  
Contented there: I would resign  
Goose, calf and pig, clothes, all our coin,  
Whatever useful thing was mine.  
That thou should'st know my faithful heart.  
How with my treasures I would part,  
That thus thou mightest have the best,  
Happy in Paradise to rest.  
 Farmer   
I trust that here I long may stay.  
Nor need such help; but, wife, I pray.  
Of what has happened, nothing say.  
 Wife   
Through all the village it is known.  
 Farmer   
Who hath the news so quickly sown?  
 Wife   
When thou wert gone, most gratefully  
I told our friends how good to me  
Thou art, of Paradise, and how  
My dear old husband is there now;  
How, by a messenger most wise,  
I sent him things to Paradise.  
It seemed that people laughed at me,  
And took the matter merrily.  
 Farmer   
The Devil take their pleasantry,  
That dares to make a scoff of thee! --  
Scoff of my wife! Dear God, I pray  
For patience! -- Hasten, wife, away,  
And bring a bowl of milk to me.  
 Wife   
Yes, husband; follow presently.  
[The Wife goes out.] 
 Farmer   
Why do I thus complain? My fate  
Hath given me a fool for mate;  
But yet a faithful fool. 'Tis true  
That lack of sense is nothing new;  
But she is silly past belief,  
And, for this fault, is no relief:  
I constantly must hold her rein.  
And her simplicity restrain;  
Must bear with her, for e'en today  
My foot from stirrup slipped away:  
Who doth the shuttlecock let fall  
Should not another clumsy call.  
Better it is I proved a fool,  
So cannot make a cruel rule,  
For, in her heart, she is so kind,  
My own to softness is inclined.  
Who falls a victim to deceit  
Should not find fault when others meet  
The like misfortune; but forgive,  
That all in peacefulness may live:  
Kind charity for faulty acts  
Redeems our own, remarks Hans Sachs.
