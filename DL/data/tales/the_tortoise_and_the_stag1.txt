One day, when the tortoise was basking in the sun, a stag passed by,
and stopped for a little conversation. 
 "Would you care to see which of us can run fastest?" asked the
tortoise, after some talk. 
 The stag thought the question so silly that he only shrugged his
shoulders. 
 "Of course, the victor would have the right to kill the other," went on
the tortoise. 
 "Oh, on that condition I agree," answered the deer, "but I am afraid
that you are a dead man." 
 "It is no use trying to frighten me," replied the tortoise. "But I
should like three days for training; then I shall be ready to start when
the sun strikes on the big tree at the edge of the great clearing." 
 The first thing the tortoise did was to call his brothers and his
cousins together, and he posted them carefully under ferns all along the
line of the great clearing, making a sort of ladder which stretched for
many miles. This done to his satisfaction, he went back to the starting
place. 
 The stag was quite punctual, and as soon as the sun's rays struck the
trunk of the tree the stag started off, and was soon far out of the sight
of the tortoise. Every now and then he would turn his head as he ran, and
call out, "How are you getting on?" and the tortoise who happened to be
nearest at the moment would answer, "All right, I am close up to you." 
 Full of astonishment, the stag would redouble his efforts, but it was
no use. Each time he asked, "Are you there?" the answer would come, "Yes,
of course, where else should I be?" And the stag ran, and ran, and ran,
till he could run no more, and dropped down dead on the grass. 
 And the tortoise, when he thinks about it, laughs still.
