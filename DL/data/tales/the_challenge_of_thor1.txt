The Challenge of Thor 
 
 
 
I AM the God Thor, 
I am the War God, 
I am the Thunderer! 
Here in my Northland,  
My fastness and fortress,  
Reign I forever! 
Here amid icebergs  
Rule I the nations;  
This is my hammer,  
Mi√∂lner the mighty;  
Giants and sorcerers  
Cannot withstand it! 
These are the gauntlets  
Wherewith I wield it,  
And hurl it afar off;  
This is my girdle;  
Whenever I brace it,  
Strength is redoubled! 
The light thou beholdest 
Stream through the heavens, 
In flashes of crimson, 
Is but my red beard  
Blown by the night-wind,  
Affrighting the nations!  
Jove is my brother;  
Mine eyes are the lightning;  
The wheels of my chariot  
Roll in the thunder,  
The blows of my hammer  
Ring in the earthquake! 
Force rules the world still, 
Has ruled it, shall rule it; 
Meekness is weakness, 
Strength is triumphant, 
Over the whole earth 
Still is it Thor's-Day! 
Thou art a God too,  
O Galilean!  
And thus singled-handed  
Unto the combat,  
Gauntlet or Gospel,  
Here I defy thee!
