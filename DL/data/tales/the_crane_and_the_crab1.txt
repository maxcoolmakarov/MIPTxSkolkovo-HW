The crane and quarreled as to their powers of racing. The crab said he 
would go the fastest, and that the crane might fly across from point to 
point, while he went round by the shore. The crane flew off, and the crab 
stayed quietly in his hole, trusting to the multitude of his brethren to 
deceive the crane. The crane flew to the first point, and seeing a crab 
hole, put down his ear, and heard a buzzing noise. "That slave is here 
before me," said he, and flew on to the next point. Here the same thing 
happened, till at last, on reaching a point above Serua, the crane fell 
exhausted, and was drowned in the sea.
