Once there were a shoemaker, a tailor, and a sailor who came upon hard times. Then they made a pact with the devil: that he should fulfill all their wishes, but for this they signed away their souls. Thus they wished for endless money, good food and drink, and everything else that they could think of.  
But the deadline soon came, and each one thought of some task that the devil would be unable fulfill, in which case they would be free of their pact.  
Thus the tailor demanded that the devil bring to him every trimming of cloth that he had ever cut off -- large and small -- in his previous tailoring. The devil should sew together into one piece every scrap that had ever fallen to the floor, and not a single stitch was to be visible.  The devil soon completed this task and wrung the tailor's neck.  
The same thing happened to the shoemaker, who demanded a single hide stitched together from the trimmings of all the shoes he had ever made.  
However, the sailor gave the devil the task of making an anchor rope out of fine sand. The devil attempted to do so, but failed, and thus the sailor saved his own life and his soul.
