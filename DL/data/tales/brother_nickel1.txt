On the Island of RÃ¼gen, in a thick forest, there is a deep lake.  It
is rich with fish, but its water is cloudy, and one cannot fish there.
Nonetheless, many long years ago a number of fishermen attempted to do so,
and brought their boat to the lake.  The next day they returned home for
their nets, and when they came back, their boat had disappeared.  Then one
of the fishermen looked around and discovered the vessel stuck in the top
of a tall beech tree.  
 
He cried out:  "Who in the devil put my boat up the tree?"
 
They saw no one, but a voice from nearby answered, saying, "The devils did
not do it.  I did it together with my brother Nickel!"
