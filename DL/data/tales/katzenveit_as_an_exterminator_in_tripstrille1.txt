A sprite is often seen around Kohlberg Mountain near Zwickau. His name is Katzenveit and his merry pranks are similar to those of RÃ¼bezahl....  Once he came to Tripstrille as an exterminator, claiming that he could drive away rats and mice. For this they promised him a handsome sum of thalers. However, after he had driven out the vermin he was not paid. Then, similar to the ratcatcher of Hameln, he returned and led away all of the citizens' cats, said to have numbered 666. From that time onward no cats have left this city.
