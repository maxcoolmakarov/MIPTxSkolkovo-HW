One day the Hodja went into the mountains to cut wood, and he took a melon with him. As he was walking along the melon fell from his arms and rolled down into the valley. A hare was sleeping there. The melon frightend him, and he ran away.  
Seeing the hare, the Hodja said: "I have done something stupid. The melon must have been pregnant, and that was a mule."  
With that he turned to his wood-cutting. When he returned home he told his wife about his adventure.  
She cried out: "Oh dear, husband, you should have caught it and brought it home! We could have ridden him to the garden!"  
The Hodja picked up a stick and said: "Get off him! He is still too young! You'll break his ribs!"
