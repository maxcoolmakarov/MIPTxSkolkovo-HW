A chief had many horses, and among them a stallion which his wife often
rode. The woman and stallion became enamoured of each other and cohabited.
The woman grew careless of her household duties and always wanted to look
after the horses.
 When the people moved camp, and the horses were brought in, it was
noticed that the stallion made right for the woman and sniffed about her
as stallions do with mares. After this she was watched.
 When her husband learned the truth, he shot the stallion. The woman
cried and would not go to bed.
 At daybreak she was gone, no one knew where. About a year after this it
was discovered that she had gone off with some wild horses. One day when
the people were traveling over a large open place they saw a band of
horses, and the woman among them. She had partly changed into a horse. Her
pubic hair had grown so long that it resembled a tail. She also had much
hair on her body, and the hair of her head had grown to resemble a horse's
mane. Her arms and legs had also changed considerably; but her face was
still human, and bore some resemblance to her original self.
 The chief sent some young men to chase her. All the wild horses ran
away, but she could not run so fast as they, and was run down and lassoed.
She was brought into her husband's lodge; and the people watched her for
some time, trying to tame her, but she continued to act and whinny like a
horse. At last they let her free. The following year they saw her again.
She had become almost entirely horse, and had a colt by her side. She had
many children afterwards.
