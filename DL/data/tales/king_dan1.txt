A legend is current in the district of Ditmarschen about the first king of Denmark, named Dan, and after whom Denmark is named. According to this legend he did not live in present-day Denmark but instead in Schleswig. Formerly and for a long time his name was included in the calendar of saints. At his time the land was entirely heathen, and the people cremated their dead and put their ashes in urns which they placed in the giants' mounds (huns' hills).  
King Dan did not want to be cremated, but instead to be buried seated on his throne and with his sattled horse by his side. And his wish was thus carried out.  
Not far from Tönningen in Eiderstede is a small earthen hill with a cave. King Dan, like Emperor Friedrich in Kyffhäser, is seated inside with two hundred thousand armed men, and all are asleep.  
Once a soldier who had been sentenced to die was promised his life if he would go into the cave and and report what he had seen. Upon entering the cave he saw the king seated at a table with his head resting on his arm, and asleep. His beard had grown so long that it hung down beneath the table.  
The king awoke and asked the soldier, "What do you want?" 
"My lord and king sent me here to bring back a message from you."  
"Tell your lord," replied King Dan, "that I will come to his aid, and that he shall rule over the entire world." 
This time has not yet come, and may well be delayed long into the future.
