Once there was a boy who struck his mother, whereupon he died.  After he
was
buried, his hand grew out of the earth.  Then the mother was told that she
should beat the hand with a switch.  The mother did this, and the dead boy
pulled his hand back under.  But the next day the hand was always there
again. 
Finally the executioner had to come and chop off the hand.  They put it in
a box
and kept it in the church.

A child's hand, wrapped in a silk cloth, is kept behind the alter in the
church
at Petschow, between Tessin and Rostock.  The people there tell how a
wayward
child had lifted his hand against his parents.  The child died soon
afterward
and was buried.  The hand that had been lifted against the parents grew
out of
the grave.  They placed it back beneath the earth several times, but it
always
reappeared, until they finally chopped it off.

In the church at Garwitz, a village in the vicinity of Parchim,
behind the
altarpiece
there is a hand that was chopped off just beneath the joint.  The
following
legend is told about it: 
A girl abused her parents, and even struck her mother so hard that the
mother
died of the consequences.  Soon after the mother's death, the girl herself
died.
 She had lain in the grave for only a few days when her wicked hand
emerged. 
The villagers beat it with whips and a few times it withdrew back beneath
the
earth.  Finally, because it ceased retreating from the whips' blows, they
chopped it off.  It is preserved even to this day.  The flesh has dried
firmly
onto the bones, and the entire hand has a black appearance.
