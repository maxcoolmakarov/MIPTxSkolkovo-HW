Between Werl and Soest there lived a man whose name was Knoist, and he
had three sons. One was blind, the other lame, and the third stark naked.
Once they were walking across a field, where they saw a hare. The blind
one shot it, the lame one caught it, and the naked one put it in his
pocket. Then they came to a tremendously large body of water, on which
there were three ships. One leaked, one sank, the third had no bottom in
it. All three got into the one with no bottom. Then they came to a
tremendously large forest in which there was a tremendously large tree. In
the tree was a tremendously large chapel. In the chapel was a sexton of
hornbeam wood and a parson of boxwood, who were passing out holy water
with cudgels.
 
 
 
 Blessed is he 
Who from this holy water can flee.
