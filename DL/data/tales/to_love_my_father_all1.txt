Lear 
Which of you shall we say doth love us most? 
That we our largest bounty may extend 
Where nature doth with merit challenge. Goneril, 
Our eldest-born, speak first.
 Goneril 
Sir, I love you more than words can wield the matter, 
Dearer than eye-sight, space and liberty, 
Beyond what can be valued, rich or rare, 
No less than life, with grace, health, beauty, honour, 
As much as child e'er loved or father found; 
A love that makes breath poor and speech unable; 
Beyond all manner of so much I love you.
 ...
 Regan 
I am made of that self metal as my sister, 
And prize me at her worth. In my true heart 
I find she names my very deed of love; 
Only she comes too short: that I profess 
Myself an enemy to all other joys 
Which the most precious square of sense possesses, 
And find I am alone felicitate 
In your dear highness' love
 ...
 Cordelia 
I cannot heave 
My heart into my mouth: I love your majesty 
According to my bond; nor more nor less.
 Lear 
How, how, Cordelia! mend your speech a little, 
Lest it may mar your fortunes.
 Cordelia 
Good my lord, 
You have begot me, bred me, loved me: I 
Return those duties back as are right fit, 
Obey you, love you, and most honour you. 
Why have my sisters husbands, if they say 
They love you all? Haply, when I shall wed, 
That lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry 
Half my love with him half my care and duty: 
Sure, I shall never marry like my sister, 
To love my father all.
