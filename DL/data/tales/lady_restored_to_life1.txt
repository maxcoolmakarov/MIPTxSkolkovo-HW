I have met with the following statement: 
 Eliza, the wife of Sir W. Fanshawe, of Woodley Hall, in
Gloucestershire, was interred, having, at her own request, a valuable
locket, which was her husband's gift, hung upon her breast. The sexton,
proceeding to the vault at night, stole the jewel, and by the admission of
fresh air restored the body, who had been only in a trance, and who, with
great difficulty, reached Woodley Hall in the dead of night, to the
general alarm of the servants. Sir William, being roused by their cries,
found his lady, with bleeding feet and clothed in the winding-sheet,
stretched upon the hall. She was put into a warm bed, and gave birth to
several children after her recovery. 
 On what authority, let me ask, has this statement been made? And, if
true, when did the occurrence take place? Change the scene to the town of
Drogheda, in Ireland, the lady's name to Harman, and the locket to a ring,
and you have a tolerably accurate account of what occurred in the last
century, and with the tradition of which I have been familiar from my
childhood.
