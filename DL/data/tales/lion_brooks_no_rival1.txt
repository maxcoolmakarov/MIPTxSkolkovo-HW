Lion was supposed to be the head of all the beast in that place. He
got so lazy ev'ry day, he had an animal come in ev'ry day so he could
eat it. Ev'yday animal went in. So finally it came the rabbit's turn
to go in. He was one of the wisest animals of that time. He was
supposed to be there at twelve o'clock. He came hoppin' along the
road, stoppin' everywhere, lookin' at everything, until it threw him off time. Wonders, whey he goin', what could he do to keep the lion from
gettin' so angry with him.   
So finally he came across a well. The
thought came to him as he looked into the well, he saw his shader, he
had a scheme to fool the lion. He had been told by the other animals
that any way he could get rid of the lion, they would pay him, give
him praise of being the wisest animal of the forest.   
He entered the
lion's room pretendin' he had been runnin', doin' all he could to get
there on time.   
The lion asked him why he was so late.   
The rabbit
began to tell him the story why he was so late. So he tol' the lion,
if he didn' believe what he had tol' him, to follow him, and he
would show him.   
So the lion went with the rabbit to the well. The
rabbit tol' the lion to get up on the curb of the well and look down into
the well, and he would see what had delayed him. So he did.   
When
he looked into the water, he saw another face, not knowing that it was
himself. He frowned, he grit his teeth, and the other lion did the same
thing. The lion on top, thinking that he was master of all the beasts
of the forest, jumped into the well, and that was the last of the lion.  
And the rabbit got the praise of being the wisest beast of the forest.
