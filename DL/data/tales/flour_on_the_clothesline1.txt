A neighbor came to the Hodja's door and asked to borrow a clothesline. 
 
 "Let me ask my wife," replied the Hodja, disappearing inside.  
 He returned a short time later with the answer, "I am sorry, dear 
friend, but we cannot lend you our clothesline, for we have sprinkled 
flour on it."  
 "When would a person ever sprinkle flour on a clothesline?" asked the 
neighbor in disbelief.  
 "When someone else wanted to borrow it," was the Hodja's answer.
