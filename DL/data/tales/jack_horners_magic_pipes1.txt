CHAP. IV  
 
How he met with an old Hermit, who for a Bottle of nappy Ale, gave him an invincible Coat and a Pair of inchanted Pipes, with which he shewed many merry Tricks. 
 
Upon a pleasant holyday.  
Jack going to a fair,  
And as he passed along the way,  
He saw a wonder there.  

An aged man sat in a Cave,  
Who could not stand nor go,  
His head bore blossoms of the grave,  
And locks as white as snow,  

Strange hollow eyes and wrinkled brow  
His nose and chin did meet,  
To him Jack Homer made a bow,  
With words both soft and sweet.  

He call'd to John and thus did say,  
Come hither lad to me,  
And if thou dost my will obey,  
Thou shalt rewarded be:  

Bring me a fairing from the town,  
At thy own proper cost,  
A jug of nappy liquor brown,  
Thy labour shan't be lost.  

Jack made the Hermit this reply,  
Who then sat in his cell,  
What's your request I'll not deny,  
And so old dad farewel.  

At night he being stout and strong,  
This Hermit he'd not fail,  
But at his back he lug'd along,  
A lusty jug of ale:  

Which when the Hermit he beheld,  
It pleas'd him to the heart;  
Out of the same cup he fill'd,  
And said, Before we part,  

I have a pipe which I'll bestow  
Upon you never doubt,  
Whoever hears you when you blow,  
Shall dance and trump about:  

They shan't be able to stand still  
While you the Music play,  
But after you o'er dale and hill,  
They all shall dance the hay.  

I have thee a coat likewise,  
Invincible I mean,  
The which shall so bedim their eyes,  
That thou shalt not be seen:  

If you with a hundred meet,  
When thus you pass along,  
Though in the very open street,  
Not one of all the throng,  

Shall ever see you in the least,  
Yet hear the music sound,  
And wonder that both man and beast,  
 Are forced to dance around.  

Jack took the Coat and Bagpipes too,  
And thankfully did say,  
Old Father I will call on you  
Whene'er I come this way.  
 
 CHAP. V  
  
How he serv'd six Fidlers, and as many Pedlers, whom he caused to dance thro' Hedge and Ditch after his Pipes, till they broke all their Glasses and Crowds. 

 

This Pipe and coat he having got,  
He homeward trudg'd with speed,  
At length it was his happy Lot  
to cross a pleasant Mead:  

Where he six Fidlers soon espy'd  
a coming from a Fair,  
Under their Coats, crowds by their sides,  
and many others there:  

Amongst the rest six jolly blades,  
after those crowders came,  
Who on their shoulders carried Crades  
with Glasses in the same.  

Jack presently his Coat put on,  
Which screen'd him from their sight,  
And said I'll do the best I can  
To plague them all this night.  

For Crowders they are Rogues I know  
And Crades-men they are worse,  
They cousin all where'er they go,  
And pick each Lass's purse.  

His pipe he then began to play,  
The Crowders they did dance,  
The Crades-men too as fast as they  
Did caper, skip, and prance.  

Still Jack play'd up a merry strain,  
Both pleasant, loud, and shrill,  
So that they danc'd and jump'd amain  
Tho' much against their Will:  

They cried, this is enchanted Ground,  
For why no soul we see,  
And yet a pleasant Music sound,  
Makes, us dance vehemently.  

Jack Homer laugh'd, and piping went  
Strait down into a hollow,  
These hair brain'd Dancers, by consent  
Did after him soon follow,  

He led them through Bogs and Sloughs  
Nay, likewise Ponds and Ditches,  
And in the thorny briar boughs  
Poor rogues they tore their Breeches,  

Each Fidler lost, or tore his Cloak,  
But yet they followed after,  
Their crow'ds were, crack'd their glasses broke,  
This was a woeful slaughter.  

At length it being something late,  
Jack did his piping leave,  
They ceased and saw their wretched state,  
Which made them sigh and grieve.  

This is, said some, Old Nick I know  
The author of this evil,  
The others cry'd out, if it be so,  
 He is a merry Devil.  

Jack Horner laugh'd and went his Way  
And left them in despair,  
So that e'er since that very day,  
The Fidlers came not there.
