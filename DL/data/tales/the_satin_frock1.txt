There was once a little girl called Mary who had a satin frock, and her 
mother told her that if she got a dirty mark on it she would kill her. One 
day as Mary was going a walk, some cows that were passing by splashed her 
frock with mud. Then Mary went and sat on a doorstep and began to cry. The 
woman in the house hearing her cry came out, and Mary told her that she 
dare not go home because she had got her frock dirty, and that her mother 
had threatened to kill her if she got it dirty. So the woman took her in 
and washed the mud from her frock, and then dried it. She then sent the 
little girl on her way, telling her to mind and not get it dirty again, 
and then her mother would not kill her.   
So Mary went on her way, but lower down the road a horse that was running 
by splashed her frock again. When she got home her mother took her in the 
cellar and cut her head off, and hung it on the wall.   
When her father came home he said, "Where is our Mary?"   
Her mother told him she had gone to her grandmother's to stay all night. 
  
When bedtime came he said, "I will fetch the sticks up;" but his wife 
said, "No, I will;" but he said, "No, I will fetch them up;" and she said, 
"No, I will;" but he would not let her fetch them.   
When he had got down in the cellar he saw the head hung up, so when he had 
come out of the cellar he asked his wife what it was. She told him that it 
was a sheep's head that she was going to make some broth of for tomorrow's 
dinner.   
When he came home to dinner next day, he said, "This broth is nice, but it 
does taste like our Mary."   
When his wife heard this she was very frightened; but when her husband 
found out what had been done he took her in the cellar and killed her.
