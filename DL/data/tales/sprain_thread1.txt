Thomas McHale of Belcarra died last year (1937) aged 86 years. He was a weaver.  
He always had a quantity of the sprain thread ready in the house. If a person sprained an ankle or anything, that person would go to Thomas and say "Thomas I got a hurt," but never ask him for the thread.  
Or somebody else would go instead of him: but in no circumstance must the thread be asked for.  
Thomas would understand, and give him a piece of the sprain thread. That piece of thread would be tied round the hurt limb, and the limb would get alright. It was only a piece of the wool-thread that the weaver used in to the loom.  
Pieces of the sprain thread have often been sent to England to cure boys from Belcarra district who suffered from sprain in England where they went to work.
