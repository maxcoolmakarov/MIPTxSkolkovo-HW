It may be worth while, in order to shew the extent to which nursery stories are provincially varied, to give the Selkirkshire version of the wee bannock:
  
There was a wife bakin' bannocks, and there was a man cam and wanted ane o' them. And he said to the wife: "Yer bannas is burnin': come awa' and I'1l turn them." 
  
And the wife said: "Na, I'll turn them;" and he said: "Na, I'll turn them;" and she said: "Na, I'1l turn them." 
  
And as they were threepin', ane o' the bannas got up and ran awa', and they couldna catch't. And it ran and ran or it cam to a sheep, and the sheep wantit it, and it said to the sheep: 
 
I've beat a wee wife,   
And I've beat a wee man,  
And I'll try and beat ye too if I can.
 
  
Sae it ran and ran, and beat the sheep. And it cam to a goat, and it said to the goat:
 
I've beat a wee wife,  
And I've beat a wee man,  
And I've beat a wee sheep,  
And I'll try and beat ye too if I can. 
 
 
And it ran and ran, and beat the goat. And it cam to a fox, and it said to the fox:
 
I've beat a wee wife,  
And I've beat a wee man,  
And I've beat a wee sheep,  
And I've beat a wee goat,  
And I'll try and beat ye too if I can. 
 
 
And the fox said: "Get on my back and I'll carry ye;" and the banna said: "Na, I'll rin mysel'." 
  
And the fox said: "Na, get on my back, and I'll carry ye o'er the burn." 
 
Sae the banna got on its back, and the fox turned round its head and took a grip o't.
 
And the banna cried: "Oh, ye're nippin's, ye're nippin's, ye're nippin's." 
 
And the fox said: "Na, I'm just clawin' mysel'." 
 
And it took anither grip, and the banna cried: "Oh, ye're nippin's, ye're nippin's, ye're nippin's." 
 
And the fox nippit it a' awa' but a wee bit, and it fell into the burn, and that was the end o' the banna.
