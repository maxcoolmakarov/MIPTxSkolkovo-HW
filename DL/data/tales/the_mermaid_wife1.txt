the sandy margin of a voe [a deep inlet], saw a number of mermen and mermaids dancing by moonlight, and several sealskins strewed beside them on the ground.  At
his approach they immediately fled to secure their garbs, and, taking upon
themselves the form of seals, plunged immediately into the sea.  But as
the Shetlander perceived that one skin lay close to his feet, he snatched
it up, bore it swiftly away, and placed it in concealment. On returning
to the shore he met the fairest damsel that was ever gazed upon by mortal
eyes, lamenting the robbery, by which she had become an exile from her
submarine friends, and a tenant of the upper world.  Vainly she implored
the restitution of her property. The man had drunk deeply of love, and was
inexorable; but he offered her protection beneath his roof as his
betrothed spouse.  The merlady, perceiving that she must become an
inhabitant of the earth, found that she could not do better than accept of
the offer. This strange attachment subsisted for many years, and the
couple had several children.  The Shetlander's love for his merwife was
unbounded, but his affection was coldly returned.  The lady would often
steal alone to the desert strand, and, on a signal being given, a large
seal would make his appearance, with whom she would hold, in an unknown
tongue, an anxious conference. Years had thus glided away, when it
happened that one of the children, in the course of his play, found
concealed beneath a stack of corn a seal's skin; and, delighted with the
prize, he ran with it to his mother.  Her eyes glistened with rapture --
she gazed upon it as her own -- as the means by which she could pass through
the ocean that led to her native home.  She burst forth into an ecstasy of
joy, which was only moderated when she beheld her children, whom she was
now about to leave; and, after hastily embracing them, she fled with all
speed towards the seaside. The husband immediately returned, learned the
discovery that had taken place, ran to overtake his wife, but only arrived
in time to see her transformation of shape completed -- to see her, in the
form of a seal, bound from the ledge of a rock into the sea.  The large
animal of the same kind with whom she had held a secret converse soon
appeared, and evidently congratulated her, in the most tender manner, on
her escape.  But before she dived to unknown depths, she cast a parting
glance at the wretched Shetlander, whose despairing looks excited in her
breast a few transient feelings of commiseration. "Farewell!" said she
to him "and may all good attend you.  I loved you very well when I resided
upon earth, but I always loved my first husband much better."
