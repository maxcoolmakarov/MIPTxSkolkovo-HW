"What's thy news today, oh Voorachai ?" said the rod.   
"'T is my own news, that I am seeking a rod to lay on Meenachug, and she eating my share of fruit."  
"Thou wilt not get me until thou gettest an axe that will reap me."   
He reached the axe.

"'T is my own news, that I am seeking -- butter to feet of dog -- dog to run deer -- deer to swim water --  water to stone -- stone to smooth axe --  axe to reap rod -- rod to lay on Meenachaig -- and she eating my share of fruit."

"Thou wilt not get bonnach from me till thou bringest in water will knead it."   
"How will I bring in the water?"   
"There is no vessel but that sowen's sieve."   
Moorachug took with him the sowen's sieve. He reached the water, and every drop he would put in the sowen's sieve it would go through.   
A hoodie came over his head, and she cried, " Gawr-rag, gawr-rag  (little silly, little silly)."   
"Thou art right, oh hoodie," said Moorachug.   
" Crèah rooah s' còinneach, crèah rooah s' còinneach, " said the hoodie.  
Moorachug set  crèah rooah s' còinneach  (brown clay and moss) to it, and he brought in the water to the kneading wife -- and he got bonnach from the kneading wife to barn gillie -- whisp from the barn gillie to the cow -- milk from the cow to the cat -- cat to hunt mouse  -- mouse to scrape butter -- butter to feet of dog -- dog to run deer -- deer to swim water -- water to stone --  stone to smooth axe -- axe to reap rod -- rod to lay on Meenaehaig -- and she eating his share of fruit.
