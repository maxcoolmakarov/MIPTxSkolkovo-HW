A carman was leaving Bunclody one morning for Dublin, when what should
he see but a neighbor's cat galloping along the side of the road, and
crying out every moment, "Tell Moll Browne, Tom Dunne is dead. Tell Moll
Browne, Tom Dunne is dead." 
 At last he got tired of this ditty, and took up a stone and flung it at
the cat, bidding himself, and Tom Browne, and Moll Dunne, to go to
Halifax, and not be botherin' him.  
 When he got to Luke Byrne's in Francis Street, where all the Wicklow
and Wexford carmen used to stop, he was taking a pot of beer in the
taproom, and began to tell the quare thing that happened on the road.
There was a comfortable-looking gray cat sitting by the fire, and the
moment he mentioned what the Bunclody cat was saying, she cried out,
"That's my husband!" That's my husband!" 
 She made only one leap out through the door, and no one ever saw her at
Luke Byrne's again.
