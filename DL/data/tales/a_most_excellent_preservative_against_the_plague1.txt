One thing I could not help observing, what befell one of the quacks, who publish'd that he had a most excellent preservative against the plague, which whoever kept about them, should never be infected, or liable to infection; this man, who we may reasonably suppose, did not go abroad without some of this  excellent preservative  in his pocket, yet was taken by the distemper, and carry'd off in two or three days.
