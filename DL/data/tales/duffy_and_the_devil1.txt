Many of the superstitions of our ancestors are preserved in quaint,
irregular rhymes, the recitation of which was the amusement of the people
in the long nights of winter. These were sung, or rather said, in a
monotone, by the professional drolls, who doubtless added such things as
they fancied would increase the interest of the story to the listeners.
Especially were they fond of introducing known characters on the scene,
and of mixing up events which had occurred within the memory of the old
people, with the more ancient legend.
 The following story, or rather parts of it, formed the subject of one
of the Cornish Christmas plays. When I was a boy, I well remember being
much delighted with the coarse acting of a set of Christmas players, who
exhibited in the "great hall" of a farmhouse at which I was visiting, and
who gave us the principal incidents of Duffy and the Devil Terrytop; one
of the company doing the part of Chorus, and filling up by rude
descriptions -- often in rhyme -- the parts which the players could not
represent.
 It was cider-making time. Squire Lovel of Trove, or more correctly,
Trewoof, rode up to Burian Churchtown to procure help. Boys and maidens
were in request, some to gather the apples from the trees, others to carry
them to the cider mill. Passing along the village as hastily as the
dignity of a squire would allow him, his attention was drawn to a great
noise -- scolding in a shrill treble voice, and crying -- proceeding from
Janey Chygwin's door. The squire rode up to the cottage, and he saw the
old woman beating her stepdaughter Duffy about the head with the skirt of
her swing-tail gown, in which she had been carrying out the ashes. She
made such a dust, that the squire was nearly choked and almost blinded
with the wood ashes.
 "What cheer, Janey?" cries the squire. "What's the to-do with you and
Duffy?"
 "Oh, the lazy hussy!" shouts Janey, "is all her time courseying and
courranting [running and chasing] with the boys! She will never stay in to
boil the porridge, knit the stockings, or spin the yarn."
 "Don't believe her, your honor," exclaims Duffy. "My knitting and
spinning is the best in the parish."
 The war of tongues continued in this strain for some time, the old
squire looking calmly on, and resolving in his mind to take Duffy home
with him to Trove, her appearance evidently pleasing him greatly. Squire
Lovel left the old and young woman to do the best they could, and went
round the village to complete his hiring.
 When he returned, peace had been declared between them, but when Lovel
expressed his desire to take Duffy home to his house to help the
housekeeper to do the spinning, "A pretty spinner she is!" shouted old
Janey at the top of her voice.
 "Try me, your honor," said Duffy, curtsying very low. "My yarns are the
best in the parish."
 "We'll soon try that," said the squire. "Janey will be glad to get
quits of thee, I see, and thou'lt be nothing loath to leave her. So jump
up behind me, Duffy."
 No sooner said than done. The maid Duffy, without ceremony, mounted
behind the squire on the horse, and they jogged silently down to Trove.
 Squire Lovel's old housekeeper was almost blind -- one eye had been put
out by an angry old wizard, and through sympathy she was rapidly losing
the power of seeing with the other. This old dame was consequently very
glad of someone to help her in spinning and knitting.
 The introduction over, the housekeeper takes Duffy up into the garret
where the wool was kept, and where the spinning was done in the summer,
and requests her to commence her work.
 The truth must be told. Duffy was an idle slut. She could neither knit
nor spin. Well, here she was left along, and, of course, expected to
produce a good specimen of her work.
 The garret was piled from the floor to the key-beams with fleeces of
wool. Duffy looked despairingly at them, and then sat herself down on the
"turn" -- the spinning wheel -- and cried out, "Curse the spinning and
knitting! The devil may spin and knit for the squire for what I care."
 Scarcely had Duffy spoken these words than she heard a rustling noise
behind some wool-packs, and forth walked a queer-looking little man, with
a remarkable pair of eyes, which seemed to send out flashes of light.
There was something uncommonly knowing in the twist of his mouth, and his
curved nose had an air of curious intelligence. He was dressed in black,
and moved towards Duffy with a jaunty air, knocking something against the
floor at every step he took.
 "Duffy dear," said this little gentleman, "I'll do all the spinning and
knitting for thee."
 "Thank 'e," says Duffy, quite astonished.
 "Duffy dear, a lady shall you be."
 "Thank 'e, your honor," smiled Duffy.
 "But, Duffy dear, remember," coaxingly said the queer little man,
"remember, that for all this, at the end of three years, you must go with
me, unless you can find out my name."
 Duffy was not the least bit frightened, nor did she hesitate long, but
presently struck a bargain with her kind but unknown friend, who told her
she had only to wish, and her every wish should be fulfilled. And as for
the spinning and knitting, she would find all she required under the black
ram's fleece.
 He then departed. How, Duffy could not tell, but in a moment the queer
little gentleman was gone.
 Duffy sung in idleness, and slept until it was time for her to make her
appearance. So she wished for some yarns, and looking under the black
fleece she found them.
 Those were shown by the housekeeper to the squire, and both declared
they had never seen such beautiful yarns.
 The next day Duffy was to knit this yarn into stockings. Duffy idled,
as only professed idlers can idle. But in due time, as if she had been
excessively industrious, she produced a pair of stockings for the old
squire.
 If the yarn was beautiful, the stocking were beyond all praise. They
were as fine as silk, and as strong as leather.
 Squire Lovel soon gave them a trial; and when he came home at night
after hunting, he declared he would never wear any other than Duffy's
stocking. He had wandered all day through brake and briar, furze and
brambles. There was not a scratch on his legs, and he was as dry as a
bone. There was no end to his praise of Duffy's stockings.
 Duffy had a rare time of it now. She could do what she pleased and rove
where she willed.
 She was dancing on the mill-bed half the day with all the gossiping
women who brought their grist to be ground. In those "good old times" the
ladies of the parish would take their corn to mill, and serge the flour
themselves. When a few of them met together, they would either tell
stories or dance whilst the corn was grinding. Sometimes the dance would
be on the mill-bed, sometimes out on the green. On some occasions the
miller's fiddle would be in request, at others the "crowd" [a sieve
covered with sheepskin] was made to do the duty of a tambourine. So Duffy
was always finding excuses to go to mill, and many "a round" would she
dance with the best people in the parish.
 Old Bet, the miller's wife, was a witch, and she found out who did
Duffy's work for her. Duffy and old Bet were always the best of friends,
and she never told anyone about Duffy's knitting friend, nor did she ever
say a word about the stockings being unfinished. There was always a stitch
down.
 On Sundays the people went to Burian Church from all parts to look at
the squire's stockings. And the old squire would stop at the cross, proud
enough to show them. He could hunt
 Through brambles and furze in all sorts of weather; 
His old shanks were as sound as if bound up in leather. 
 Duffy was now sought after by all the young men of the country; and at
last the squire, fearing to lose a pretty girl, and one who was so useful
to him, married her himself, and she became, according to the fashion of
the time and place, Lady Lovel. But she was commonly known by her
neighbors as the Duffy Lady.
 Lady Lovel kept the devil hard at work. Stockings, all sorts of fine
underclothing, bedding, and much ornamental work, the like of which was
never seen, was produced at command and passed off as her own.
 Duffy passed a merry time of it, but somehow or other she was never
happy when she was compelled to play the lady. She passed much more of her
time with the old crone at the mill than in the drawing room at Trove. The
squire sported and drank, and cared little about Duffy, so long as she
provided him with knitted garments.
 The three years were nearly at an end. Duffy had tried every plan to
find out the devil's name, but had failed in all.
 She began to fear that she should have to go off with her queer friend,
and Duffy became melancholy. Old Bet endeavored to rouse her, persuading
her that she could, from her long experience and many dealings with the
imps of darkness, at the last moment put her in the way of escaping her
doom. Duffy went day after day to her garret, and there each day was the
devil gibing and jeering till she was almost mad.
 There was but another day. Bet was seriously consulted now, and -- as
good as her word -- she promised to use her power. Duffy Lady was to bring
down to the mill that very evening a jack [leather jug] of the strongest
beer she had in the cellar. She was not to go to bed until the squire
returned from hunting, no matter how late, and she was to make no remark
in reply to anything the squire might tell her.
 The jack of beer was duly carried to the mill, and Duffy returned home
very melancholy to wait up for the squire.
 No sooner had Lady Lovel left the mill than old Bet came out with the
"crowd" over her shoulders, and the blackjack [tar-coated leather jug] in
her hand. She shut the door, and turned the water off the mill-wheel,
threw her red cloak about her, and away.
 She was seen by her neighbors going towards Boleit. A man saw the old
woman trudging past the Pipers, and through the Dawnse Main into the
downs, but there he lost sight of her, and no one could tell where old Bet
was gone to at that time of night.
 Duffy waited long and anxiously. By and by the dogs came home alone.
They were covered with foam, their tongues were hanging out of their
mouths, and all the servants said they must have met the devil's hounds
without heads.
 Duffy was seriously alarmed. Midnight came but no squire. At last he
arrived, but like a crazy, crack-brained man, he kept singing:
 Here's to the devil, 
With his wooden pick and shovel. 
 He was neither drunk nor frightened, but wild with some strange
excitement. After a long time Squire Lovel sat down, and began, "My dear
Duffy, you haven't smiled this long time. But now I'll tell 'e something
that would make ye laugh if ye're dying. If you'd seen what I've seen
tonight, ha, ha, ha!
 Here's to the devil, 
With his wooden pick and shovel." 
 True to her orders, Duffy said not a word, but allowed the squire to
ramble on as he pleased. At length he told her the following story of his
adventures, with interruptions which have not been retained, and with
numerous coarse expressions which are best forgotten:
 The squire's story of the meeting of the witches in the Fugoe Hole:
 
Duffy dear, I left home at break of day this morning. I hunted
all the moors from Trove to Trevider, and never started a hare all the
livelong day. I determined to hunt all night, but that I'd have a brace to
bring home.
 So, at nightfall I went down Lemorna Bottoms, then up Brene
Downses, and as we passed the Dawnse Main up started a hare, as fine a
hare as ever was seen. She passed the Pipers, down through the Reens, in
the mouth of the dogs half the time, yet they couldn't catch her at all.
As fine a chase as ever was seen, until she took into the Fugoe Hole. In
went the dogs after her, and I followed, the owls and bats flying round my
head. On we went, through water and mud, a mile or more, I'm quite
certain. I didn't know the place was so long before. At last we came to a
broad pool of water, when the dogs lost the scent and ran back past me
howling and jowling, terrified almost to death!
 A little farther on I turned round a corner, and saw a
glimmering fire on the other side the water, and there were St. Leven
witches in scores. Some were riding on ragwort, some on brooms, some were
floating on their three-legged stools, and some, who had been milking the
little good cows in Wales, had come back astride of the largest leeks they
could find. Amongst the rest there was our Bet of the mill, with her
"crowd" in her hand, and my own blackjack slung across her
shoulders.
 In a short time the witches gathered round the fire, and
blowed it up, after a strange fashion, till it burned up into a brilliant
blue flame. Then I saw amongst the rest a queer little man in black, with
a long forked tail, which he held high in the air, and twirled around. Bet
struck her "crowd" as soon as he appeared, and beat up the
tune: 
 Here's to the devil, 
With his wooden pick and shovel, 
Digging tin by the bushel, 
With his tail cock'd up! 
 Then the queer little devil and all danced like the wind, and
went faster and faster, making such a clatter, "as if they had on each
foot a pewter platter."
 Every time the man in black came round by old Bet, he took a
good pull from my own blackjack, till at last, as if he had been drinking
my best beer, he seemed to have lost his head, when he jumped up and down,
turned round and round, and roaring with laughter, sung:
 
 Duffy, my lady, you'll never know -- what? -- 
That my name is Terrytop, Terrytop -- top!
 
 When the squire sung those lines, he stopped suddenly, thinking that
Duffy was going to die. She turned pale, and red, and pale again. However,
Duffy said nothing, and the squire proceeded:
 After the dance, all the witches made a ring around the fire,
and again blew it up, until the blue flames reached the top of the Zawn [a
cavernous gorge]. Then the devil danced through and through the fire, and
springing ever and anon amongst the witches, kicked them soundly. At last
-- I was shaking with laughter at the fun -- I shouted, "Go it, Old Nick!"
and lo, the lights went out, and I had to fly with all my speed, for every
one of the witches were after me. I scampered home somehow, and here I am.
Why don't you laugh, Duffy? 
Duffy did laugh, and laugh right heartily now, and when tired of their
fun, the squire and the lady went to bed.
 The three years were up within an hour. Duffy had willed for an
abundant supply of knitted things, and filled every chest in the house.
She was in the best chamber trying to cram some more stockings into a big
chest, when the queer little man in black appeared before her.
 "Well, Duffy, my dear," said he, "I have been true to my word and
served you truly for three years as we agreed, so now I hope you will go
with me, and make no objection." He bowed very obsequiously, almost to the
ground, and regarded Duffy Lady with a very offensive leer.
 "I fear," smiled Duffy, "that your country is rather warm, and might
spoil my fair complexion."
 "It is not so hot as some people say, Duffy," was his reply. "But come
along. I've kept my word, and of course a lady of your standing will keep
your word also. Can you tell me my name?"
 Duffy curtsied, and smilingly said, "You have behaved like a true
gentleman, yet I wouldn't like to go so far."
 The devil frowned and approached as if he would lay forcible hands upon
her.
 "Maybe your name is Lucifer?"
 He stamped his foot and grinned horridly. "Lucifer! Lucifer! He's no
other than a servant to me in my own country." Suddenly calming again, he
said, quietly, "Lucifer! I would scarcely be seen speaking to him at
court. But come along. When I spin for ladies I expect honorable treatment
at their hands. You've two guesses more. But they're of little use. My
name is not generally known on earth."
 "Perhaps," smiled Duffy again, "my lord's name is Beelzebub?"
 How he grinned, and his sides shook with convulsive joy. "Beelzebub!"
says he. "I believe he's some sort of a cousin -- a Cornish cousin you
know."
 "I hope your honor," curtsied Duffy, "will not take offence. Impute my
mistake to ignorance."
 Our demon was rampant with joy. He danced around Duffy with delight,
and was, seeing that she hesitated, about to seize her somewhat roughly.
 "Stop! Stop!" shouts Duffy. "Perhaps you will be honest enough to admit
that your name is Terrytop."
 The gentleman in black looked at Duffy, and she steadily looked him in
the face. "Terrytop! Deny it if you dare," says she.
 "A gentleman never denies his name," replied Terrytop, drawing himself
up with much dignity. "I did not expect to be beaten by a young minx like
you, Duffy. But the pleasure of your company is merely postponed."
 With this Terrytop departed in fire and smoke, and all the devil's
knitting suddenly turned to ashes.
 Squire Lovel was out hunting, away far on the moors. The day was cold
and the winds piercing. Suddenly the stockings dropped from his legs and
the homespun from his back, so that he came home with nothing on but his
shirt and his shoes, almost dead with cold. All this was attributed by the
squire to the influence of old Bet, who, he thought, had punished him for
pursuing her with his dogs when she had assumed the form of a hare.
 The story, as told by the drolls, now rambles on. Duffy cannot furnish
stockings. The squire is very wroth. There are many quarrels -- mutual
recriminations. Duffy's old sweetheart is called in to beat the squire,
and eventually peace is procured, by a stratagem of old Bet's, which would
rather shock the sense of propriety in these our days.
