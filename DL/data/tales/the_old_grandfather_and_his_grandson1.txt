Once upon a time there was an old man who could hardly walk. His knees
shook. He could not hear or see very well, and he did not have any teeth
left. When he sat at the table, he could scarcely hold a spoon. He spilled
soup on the tablecloth, and, beside that, some of his soup would run back
out of his mouth. His son and his son's wife were disgusted with this, so
finally they made the old grandfather sit in the corner behind the stove,
where they gave him his food in an earthenware bowl, and not enough at
that. He sat there looking sadly at the table, and his eyes grew moist.
One day his shaking hands could not hold the bowl, and it fell to the
ground and broke. The young woman scolded, but he said not a word. He only
sobbed. Then for a few hellers they bought him a wooden bowl and made him
eat from it. Once when they were all sitting there, the little grandson of
four years pushed some pieces of wood together on the floor. 
 "What are you making?" asked his father. 
 "Oh, I'm making a little trough for you and mother to eat from when I'm
big." 
 The man and the woman looked at one another and then began to cry. They
immediately brought the old grandfather to the table, and always let him
eat there from then on. And if he spilled a little, they did not say a
thing.
