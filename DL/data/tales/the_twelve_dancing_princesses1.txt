I. 
Once upon a time there lived in the village of Montignies-sur-Roc a little 
cow-boy, without either father or mother. His real name was Michael, but 
he was always called the Star Gazer, because when he drove his cows over 
the commons to seek for pasture, he went along with his head in the air, 
gaping at nothing.   
As he had a white skin, blue eyes, and hair that curled all over his head, 
the village girls used to cry after him, "Well, Star Gazer, what are you 
doing? " and Michael would answer, "Oh, nothing," and go on his way 
without even turning to look at them.   
The fact was he thought them very ugly, with their sun-burnt necks, their 
great red hands, their coarse petticoats and their wooden shoes. He had 
heard that somewhere in the world there were girls whose necks were white 
and whose hands were small, who were always dressed in the finest silks 
and laces, and were called princesses, and while his companions round the 
fire saw nothing in the flames but common everyday fancies, he dreamed 
that he had the happiness to marry a princess.  
 II.  
One morning about the middle of August, just at mid-day when the sun was 
hottest, Michael ate his dinner of a piece of dry bread, and went to sleep 
under an oak. And while he slept he dreamt that there appeared before him 
a beautiful lady, dressed in a robe of cloth of gold, who said to him, "Go 
to the castle of Beloeil, and there you shall marry a princess."   
That evening the little cow-boy, who had been thinking a great deal about 
the advice of the lady in the golden dress, told his dream to the farm 
people. But, as was natural, they only laughed at the Star Gazer.   
The next day at the same hour he went to sleep again under the same tree. 
The lady appeared to him a second time, and said, "Go to the castle of 
Beloeil, and you shall marry a princess."   
In the evening Michael told his friends that he had dreamed the same dream 
again, but they only laughed at him more than before. "Never mind," he 
thought to himself; "if the lady appears to me a third time, I will do as 
she tells me."   
The following day, to the great astonishment of all the village, about two 
o'clock in the afternoon a voice was heard singing: 
  
Raleô, raleô,   
How the cattle go! 
  
It was the little cow-boy driving his herd back to the byre.   
The farmer began to scold him furiously, but he answered quietly, "I am 
going away," made his clothes into a bundle, said good-bye to all his 
friends, and boldly set out to seek his fortunes.   
There was great excitement through all the village, and on the top of the 
hill the people stood holding their sides with laughing, as they watched 
the Star Gazer trudging bravely along the valley with his bundle at the 
end of his stick. It was enough to make anyone laugh, certainly.  
 III.  
It was well known for full twenty miles round that there lived in the 
castle of Beloeil twelve princesses of wonderful beauty, and as proud as 
they were beautiful, and who were besides so very sensitive and of such 
truly royal blood, that they would have felt at once the presence of a pea 
in their beds, even if the mattresses had been laid over it.   
It was whispered about that they led exactly the lives that princesses 
ought to lead, sleeping far into the morning, and never getting up till 
midday. They had twelve beds all in the same room, but what was very 
extraordinary was the fact that though they were locked in by triple 
bolts, every morning their satin shoes were found worn into holes.   
When they were asked what they had been doing all night, they always 
answered that they had been asleep; and, indeed, no noise was ever heard 
in the room, yet the shoes could not wear themselves out alone!   
At last the Duke of Beloeil ordered the trumpet to be sounded, and a 
proclamation to be made that whoever could discover how his daughters wore 
out their shoes should choose one of them for his wife.   
On hearing the proclamation a number of princes arrived at the castle to 
try their luck. They watched all night behind the open door of the 
princesses, but when the morning came they had all disappeared, and no one 
could tell what had become of them.  
 IV.  
When he reached the castle, Michael went straight to the gardener and 
offered his services. Now it happened that the garden boy had just been 
sent away, and though the Star Gazer did not look very sturdy, the 
gardener agreed to take him, as he thought that his pretty face and golden 
curls would please the princesses.   
The first thing he was told was that when the princesses got up he was to 
present each one with a bouquet, and Michael thought that if he had 
nothing more unpleasant to do than that he should get on very well.   
Accordingly he placed himself behind the door of the princesses' room, 
with the twelve bouquets in a basket. He gave one to each of the sisters, 
and they took them without even deigning to look at the lad, except Lina 
the youngest, who fixed her large black eyes as soft as velvet on him, and 
exclaimed, "Oh, how pretty he is -- our new flower boy!" The rest all 
burst out laughing, and the eldest pointed out that a princess ought never 
to lower herself by looking at a garden boy.   
Now Michael knew quite well what had happened to all the princes, but 
notwithstanding, the beautiful eyes of the princess Lina inspired him with 
a violent longing to try his fate. Unhappily he did not dare to come 
forward, being afraid that he should only be jeered at, or even turned 
away from the castle on account of his impudence.  
 V.   
Nevertheless, the Star Gazer had another dream. The lady in the golden 
dress appeared to him once more, holding in one hand two young laurel 
trees, a cherry laurel and a rose laurel, and in the other hand a little 
golden rake, a little golden bucket, and a silken towel.   
She thus addressed him, "Plant these two laurels in two large pots, rake 
them over with the rake, water them with the bucket, and wipe them with 
the towel. When they have grown as tall as a girl of fifteen, say to each 
of them, 'My beautiful laurel, with the golden rake I have raked you, with 
the golden bucket I have watered you, with the silken towel I have wiped 
you.' Then after that ask anything you choose, and the laurels will give 
it to you."   
Michael thanked the lady in the golden dress, and when he woke he found 
the two laurel bushes beside him. So he carefully obeyed the orders he had 
been given by the lady.   
The trees grew very fast, and when they were as tall as a girl of fifteen 
he said to the cherry laurel, "My lovely cherry laurel, with the golden 
rake I have raked thee, with the golden bucket I have watered thee, with 
the silken towel I have wiped thee. Teach me how to become invisible." 
Then there instantly appeared on the laurel a pretty white flower, which 
Michael gathered and stuck into his buttonhole.  
 VI.  
That evening, when the princesses went upstairs to bed, he followed them 
barefoot, so that he might make no noise, and hid himself under one of the 
twelve beds, so as not to take up much room.   
The princesses began at once to open their wardrobes and boxes. They took 
out of them the most magnificent dresses, which they put on before their 
mirrors, and when they had finished, turned themselves all round to admire 
their appearances. Michael could see nothing from his hiding place, but he 
could hear everything, and he listened to the princesses laughing and 
jumping with pleasure.   
At last the eldest said, "Be quick, my sisters, our partners will be 
impatient."   
At the end of an hour, when the Star Gazer heard no more noise, he peeped 
out and saw the twelve sisters in splendid garments, with their satin 
shoes on their feet, and in their hands the bouquets he had brought them. 
  
"Are you ready?" asked the eldest.   
"Yes," replied the other eleven in chorus, and they took their places one 
by one behind her.   
Then the eldest princess clapped her hands three times and a trap door 
opened. All the princesses disappeared down a secret staircase, and 
Michael hastily followed them.   
As he was following on the steps of the princess Lina, he carelessly trod 
on her dress.   
"There is somebody behind me," cried the princess; "they are holding my 
dress."   
"You foolish thing," said her eldest sister, "you are always afraid of 
something. It is only a nail which caught you."  
 VII.  
They went down, down, down, till at last they came to a passage with a 
door at one end, which was only fastened with a latch. The eldest princess 
opened it, and they found themselves immediately in a lovely little wood, 
where the leaves were spangled with drops of silver which shone in the 
brilliant light of the moon.   
They next crossed another wood where the leaves were sprinkled with gold, 
and after that another still, where the leaves glittered with diamonds. 
  
At last the Star Gazer perceived a large lake, and on the shores of the 
lake twelve little boats with awnings, in which were seated twelve 
princes, who, grasping their oars, awaited the princesses.   
Each princess entered one of the boats, and Michael slipped into that 
which held the youngest. The boats glided along rapidly, but Lina's, from 
being heavier, was always behind the rest.   
"We never went so slowly before," said the princess; "what can be the 
reason?"   
"I don't know," answered the prince. "I assure you I am rowing as hard as 
I can."   
On the other side of the lake the garden boy saw a beautiful castle 
splendidly illuminated, whence came the lively music of fiddles, 
kettledrums, and trumpets. In a moment they touched land, and the company 
jumped out of the boats; and the princes, after having securely fastened 
their barks, gave their arms to the princesses and conducted them to the 
castle.  
 VIII.  
Michael followed, and entered the ballroom in their train. Everywhere were 
mirrors, lights, flowers, and damask hangings.   
The Star Gazer was quite bewildered at the magnificence of the sight. He 
placed himself out of the way in a corner, admiring the grace and beauty 
of the princesses. Their loveliness was of every kind. Some were fair and 
some were dark; some had chestnut hair, or curls darker still, and some 
had golden locks. Never were so many beautiful princesses seen together at 
one time, but the one whom the cow-boy thought the most beautiful and the 
most fascinating was the little princess with the velvet eyes.   
With what eagerness she danced! Leaning on her partner's shoulder she 
swept by like a whirlwind. Her cheeks flushed, her eyes sparkled, and it 
was plain that she loved dancing better than anything else.   
The poor boy envied those handsome young men with whom she danced so 
gracefully, but he did not know how little reason he had to be jealous of 
them. The young men were really the princes who, to the number of fifty at 
least, had tried to steal the princesses' secret. The princesses had made 
them drink something of a philter, which froze the heart and left nothing 
but the love of dancing.  
 IX.  
They danced on till the shoes of the princesses were worn into holes. When 
the cock crowed the third time the fiddles stopped, and a delicious supper 
was served by negro boys, consisting of sugared orange flowers, 
crystallized rose leaves, powdered violets, cracknels, wafers, and other 
dishes, which are, as everyone knows, the favorite food of princesses.   
After supper, the dancers all went back to their boats, and this time the 
Star Gazer entered that of the eldest princess. They crossed again the 
wood with the diamond-spangled leaves, the wood with gold-sprinkled 
leaves, and the wood whose leaves glittered with drops of silver, and as a 
proof of what he had seen, the boy broke a small branch from a tree in the 
last wood. Lina turned as she heard the noise made by the breaking of the 
branch.   
"What was that noise?" she said.   
"It was nothing," replied her eldest sister; "it was only the screech of 
the barn owl that roosts in one of the turrets of the castle."   
While she was speaking Michael managed to slip in front, and running up 
the staircase, he reached the princesses' room first. He flung open the 
window, and sliding down the vine which climbed up the wall, found himself 
in the garden just as the sun was beginning to rise, and it was time for 
him to set to his work.  
 X.  
That day, when he made up the bouquets, Michael hid the branch with the 
silver drops in the nosegay intended for the youngest princess.   
When Lina discovered it she was much surprised. However, she said nothing 
to her sisters, but as she met the boy by accident while she was walking 
under the shade of the elms, she suddenly stopped as if to speak to him; 
then, altering her mind, went on her way.   
The same evening the twelve sisters went again to the ball, and the Star 
Gazer again followed them and crossed the lake in Lina's boat. This time 
it was the prince who complained that the boat seemed very heavy.   
"It is the heat," replied the princess. "I, too, have been feeling very 
warm."   
During the ball she looked everywhere for the gardener's boy, but she 
never saw him.   
As they came back, Michael gathered a branch from the wood with the 
gold-spangled leaves, and now it was the eldest princess who heard the 
noise that it made in breaking.   
"It is nothing," said Lina; "only the cry of the owl which roosts in the 
turrets of the castle."  
 XI.  
As soon as she got up she found the branch in her bouquet. When the 
sisters went down she stayed a little behind and said to the cow-boy, 
"Where does this branch come from?"   
"Your Royal Highness knows well enough," answered Michael.   
"So you have followed us?"   
"Yes, princess."   
"How did you manage it? We never saw you."   
"I hid myself," replied the Star Gazer quietly.   
The princess was silent a moment, and then said, "You know our secret! 
Keep it. Here is the reward of your discretion." And she flung the boy a 
purse of gold.   
"I do not sell my silence," answered Michael, and he went away without 
picking up the purse.   
For three nights Lina neither saw nor heard anything extraordinary; on the 
fourth she heard a rustling among the diamond-spangled leaves of the wood. 
That day there was a branch of the trees in her bouquet.   
She took the Star Gazer aside, and said to him in a harsh voice, "You know 
what price my father has promised to pay for our secret?"   
"I know, princess," answered Michael.   
"Don't you mean to tell him?"   
"That is not my intention."   
"Are you afraid?"   
"No, princess."   
"What makes you so discreet, then?"   
But Michael was silent.  
 XII.  
Lina's sisters had seen her talking to the little garden boy, and jeered 
at her for it.   
"What prevents your marrying him?" asked the eldest. "You would become a 
gardener too; it is a charming profession. You could live in a cottage at 
the end of the park, and help your husband to draw up water from the well, 
and when we get up you could bring us our bouquets."   
The princess Lina was very angry, and when the Star Gazer presented her 
bouquet, she received it in a disdainful manner.   
Michael behaved most respectfully. He never raised his eyes to her, but 
nearly all day she felt him at her side without ever seeing him.   
One day she made up her mind to tell everything to her eldest sister.   
"What!" said she, "this rogue knows our secret, and you never told me! I 
must lose no time in getting rid of him."   
"But how?"   
"Why, by having him taken to the tower with the dungeons, of course."   
For this was the way that in old times beautiful princesses got rid of 
people who knew too much. But the astonishing part of it was that the 
youngest sister did not seem at all to relish this method of stopping the 
mouth of the gardener's boy, who, after all, had said nothing to their 
father.  
 XIII.  
It was agreed that the question should be submitted to the other ten 
sisters. All were on the side of the eldest. Then the youngest sister 
declared that if they laid a finger on the little garden boy, she would 
herself go and tell their father the secret of the holes in their shoes. 
  
At last it was decided that Michael should be put to the test; that they 
would take him to the ball, and at the end of supper would give him the 
philter which was to enchant him like the rest.   
They sent for the Star Gazer, and asked him how he had contrived to learn 
their secret; but still he remained silent. Then, in commanding tones, the 
eldest sister gave him the order they had agreed upon.   
He only answered, " I will obey."   
He had really been present, invisible, at the council of princesses, and 
had heard all; but he had make up his mind to drink of the philter, and 
sacrifice himself to the happiness of her he loved. Not wishing, however, 
to cut a poor figure at the ball by the side of the other dancers, he went 
at once to the laurels, and said, "My lovely rose laurel, with the golden 
rake I have raked thee, with the golden bucket I have watered thee, with a 
silken towel I have dried thee. Dress me like a prince."   
A beautiful pink flower appeared. Michael gathered it, and found himself 
in a moment clothed in velvet, which was as black as the eyes of the 
little princess, with a cap to match, a diamond aigrette, and a blossom of 
the rose laurel in his buttonhole. Thus dressed, he presented himself that 
evening before the Duke of Beloeil, and obtained leave to try and discover 
his daughters' secret. He looked so distinguished that hardly anyone would 
have known who he was.  
 XIV.  
The twelve princesses went upstairs to bed. Michael followed them, and 
waited behind the open door till they gave the signal for departure.   
This time he did not cross in Lina's boat. He gave his arm to the eldest 
sister, danced with each in turn, and was so graceful that everyone was 
delighted with him. At last the time came for him o dance with the little 
princess. She found him the best partner in the world, but he did not dare 
to speak a single word to her.   
When he was taking her back to her place she said to him in a mocking 
voice, "Here you are at the summit of your wishes. You are being treated 
like a prince."   
"Don't be afraid," replied the Star Gazer gently. "You shall never be a 
gardener's wife."   
The little princess stared at him with a frightened face, and he left her 
without waiting for an answer. When the satin slippers were worn through 
the fiddles stopped, and the negro boys set the table. Michael was placed 
next to the eldest sister, and opposite to the youngest.   
They gave him the most exquisite dishes to eat, and the most delicate 
wines to drink; and in order to turn his head more completely, compliments 
and flattery were heaped on him from every side. But he took care not to 
be intoxicated, either by the wine or the compliments.  
 XV.  
At last the eldest sister made a sign, and one of the black pages brought 
in a large golden cup.   
"The enchanted castle has no more secrets for you," she said to the Star 
Gazer. "Let us drink to your triumph." He cast a lingering glance at the 
little princess, and without hesitation lifted the cup.   
"Don't drink!" suddenly cried out the little princess; "I would rather 
marry a gardener." And she burst into tears.   
Michael flung the contents .of the cup behind him, sprang over the table, 
and fell at Lina's feet. The rest of the princes fell likewise at the 
knees of the princesses, each of whom chose a husband and raised him to 
her side. The charm was broken.   
The twelve couples embarked in the boats, which crossed back many times in 
order to carry over the other princes. Then they all went through the 
three woods, and when they had passed the door of the underground passage 
a great noise was heard, as if the enchanted castle was crumbling to the 
earth.   
They went straight to the room of the Duke of Beloeil, who had just awoke. 
Michael held in his hand the golden cup, and he revealed the secret of the 
holes in the shoes.   
"Choose, then," said the duke, "whichever you prefer."   
"My choice is already made," replied the garden boy, and he offered his 
hand to the youngest princess, who blushed and lowered her eyes.  
 XVI.  
 The princess Lina did not become a gardener's wife; on the contrary, it 
was the Star Gazer who became a prince. But before the marriage ceremony 
the princess insisted that her lover should tell her how he came to 
discover the secret. So he showed her the two laurels which had helped 
him, and she, like a prudent girl, thinking they gave him too much 
advantage over his wife, cut them off at the root and threw them in the 
fire.   
And this is why the country girls go about singing:  
 
Nous n'irons plus au bois,   
Les lauriers sont coupés, 
  
and dancing in summer by the light of the moon.
