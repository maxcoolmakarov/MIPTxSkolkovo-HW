In addition to the gods, heathens knew a whole row of lower demons which can be placed together under the names sprites and elves. They constitute a distinct spirit realm on earth, independent of the world of humans. They possess supernatural powers with which they harm and help humans. However, they shy away from humans, because physically they are not our equals. In Bohemia they tell about the origin of these demons as follows:  
 
When God cast out the arrogant angels from heaven, they became the evil 
spirits that plague mankind day and night, tormenting us and inflicting us with harm. 
The ones who fell into hell and into caves and abysses became devils and 
death-maidens. However, those who fell onto the earth became goblins, 
imps, dwarfs, thumblings, alps, noon-and-evening-ghosts, and 
will-o'-the-wisps. Those who fell into the forests became the wood-spirits 
who live there: the hey-men, the wild-men, the forest-men, the wild-women, 
and the forest-women. Finally, those who fell into the water became water 
spirits: water-men, mermaids, and merwomen.
