During the flood, Old Man was sitting on the highest mountain with all 
the beasts. The flood was caused by the above people, because the baby (a 
fungus) of the woman who married a star was heedlessly torn in pieces by 
an Indian child.  
 Old Man sent the Otter down to get some earth. For a long time he 
waited, then the Otter came up dead. Old Man examined its feet, but found 
nothing on them. Next he sent Beaver down, but after a long time he also 
came up drowned. Again nothing was found on his feet. He sent Muskrat to 
dive next. Muskrat also was drowned.  
 At length he sent the Duck (?). It was drowned, but in its paw held 
some earth. Old Man saw it, put it in his hand, feigned putting it on the 
water three times, and at last dropped it. Then the above-people sent 
rain, and everything grew on the earth.
