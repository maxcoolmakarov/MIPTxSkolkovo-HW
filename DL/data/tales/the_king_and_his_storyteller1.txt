A certain king had a storyteller who told him five stories every night. It happened once that the king, oppressed by cares of state, was unable to sleep, and asked for more than the usual number of stories. The storyteller related three short ones.   
The king wished for more still, and when the story-teller demurred, said, "You have told me several very short ones. I want something long, and then you may go to sleep."   
The storyteller yielded, and began thus: "Once upon a time there was a certain countryman who went to market and bought two thousand sheep. On his way home a great inundation took place, so that he was unable to cross a certain river by the ford or bridge. After anxiously seeking some means of getting across with his flock, he found at length a little boat in which he could convey two sheep over."   
After the storyteller had got thus far he went to sleep. The king roused him and ordered him to finish the story he had begun.   
The storyteller answered, "The flood is great, the boat small, and the flock innumerable; let the aforesaid countryman get his sheep over, and I will finish the story I have begun."
