At the time Plesse Castle was to be built people generally believed that a 
castle could not be conquered if a living child had been entombed in its 
foundation. Therefore a child was to be entombed alive in the foundation 
of Plesse Castle. It was proclaimed in all municipalities a sum of money 
would be given to anyone who would surrender a child for this purpose. For 
a long time no willing person could be found, but finally a woman from 
Reiershausen sold her deaf-and-dumb  three-year old child for 300 
three-pfennig coins. On the day that the child was to be entombed it was 
suddenly able to speak, and said, "Mother's breast was softer than a 
pillow, but mother's heart was harder than a stone." And with that the 
child was entombed.
