Jack [o' Kent] and the devil built the bridge over the Monnow between
Kentchurch and Grosmont in a single night. What they built by night fell
down by day as long as the bridge remained incomplete, hence the need for
haste. The first passenger to pass over the bridge was to belong to the
devil, so Jack threw a bone across, and a poor dog ran after it. That dog
was all the devil had for his pains.
