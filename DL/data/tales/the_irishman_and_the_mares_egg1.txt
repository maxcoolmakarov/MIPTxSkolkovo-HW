An Irishman had not been long in this country when he was sold a pumpkin by a country fellow, who told him that it was a "mare's egg." The Irishman continued his journey, carrying the pumpkin; but he soon got tired, and sat down to rest on the crest of a hill. The pumpkin rolled down the slope and was smashed to pieces.  
As it hit a brush-heap at the bottom, a rabbit ran away; and the Irishman jumped up, shouting, "Catch him, catch him! He is a race-horse."
