Sewingshields lies between the Roman Wall and the military road, near the
twenty-eighth milestone from Newcastle, and at the western extremity of
Warden Parish.  Of Sewingshields Castle, Mr. Hodgson informs us that in
his time a square, low, lumpy mass of ruins, overgrown with nettles, still
remained.  "Its site is on the end of a dry ridge and overlooked from the
south by the basaltic cliffs, along the brow of which the Roman Wall was
built.  There are also some traces of trenches near it."  [Hodgson's
 History of Northumberland,   part ii, vol. iii.  (Note in original)]
This is the castle referred to by Sir Walter Scott in the sixth canto of
 Harold the Dauntless    as the "castle of the seven shields."  In
reference to its present condition Dr. Bruce remarks: 
 
 
... No towers are seen 
On the wild heath, but those that Fancy builds. 
And save a fosse that tracks the moor with green, 
Is nought remains to tell of what may there have been.   
[ Wallet-Book of the Roman Wall,   p. 109.  (Note in original.  This book is Denham's source of the legend that follows.)] 
 
 
It stood in the center of the only patch of ground in "the moss," which is
now subjected to the plow.  The walls have been uprooted and the vaults
removed, but the following tradition relating to it will not readily
perish: 
Immemorial tradition has asserted that King Arthur, his queen Guinevere,
his court of lords and ladies, and his hounds, were enchanted in some cave
of the crags, or in a hall below the Castle of Sewingshields, and would
continue entranced there till someone should first blow a bugle-horn that
lay on a table near the entrance of the hall, and then, with "the sword of
the stone," cut a garter also placed there beside it.  But none had ever
heard where the entrance to this enchanted hall was till the farmer at
Sewingshields, about fifty years since, was sitting knitting on the ruins
of the castle and his clew fell and ran downwards through a rush of briars
and nettles, as he supposed, into a deep subterranean passage.   
Full in the faith that the entrance into King Arthur's hall was now discovered, he
cleared the briary portal of its weeds and rubbish, and, entering a
vaulted passage, followed, in his darkling way, the thread of his clew.
The floor was infested with toads and lizards; and the dark wings of bats,
disturbed by his unhallowed intrusion, flitted fearfully around him.  At
length his sinking courage was strengthened by a dim, distant light, which
as he advanced grew gradually brighter, till at once he entered a vast and
vaulted hall, in the center of which a fire without fuel, from a broad
crevice in the floor, blazed with a high and lambent flame that showed all
the carved walls and fretted roof, and the monarch and his queen and court
reposing around in a theater of thrones and costly couches.    
On the floor, beyond the fire, lay the faithful and deep-toned pack of thirty couple of hounds; and on a table before it the spell-dispelling horn, sword and garter.  The shepherd reverently but firmly grasped the sword, and as he drew it leisurely from its rusty scabbard the eyes of the monarch, and his courtiers began to open, and they rose till they sat upright.  He cut the garter; and as the sword was being slowly sheathed the spell assumed its ancient power, and they all gradually sank to rest; but not before the monarch had lifted up his eyes and hands and exclaimed: 
 
O woe betide that evil day 
On which the witless wight was born, 
Who drew the sword -- the garter cut, 
But never blew the bugle-horn. 
 
Of this favorite tradition the most remarkable variation is respecting the
place where the farmer descended.  Some say that after the king's
denunciation, terror brought on a loss of memory, and he was unable to
give any correct account of his adventure or the place where it occurred.
But all agree that Mrs. Spearman, the wife of another and more recent
occupier of the estate, had a dream in which she saw a rich hoard of
treasure among the ruins of the castle, and that for many days together
she stood over workmen employed in searching for it, but without success.
