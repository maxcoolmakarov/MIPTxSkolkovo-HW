The Legend Book of Lausitz  
A child must always have someone nearby until it is six weeks old.  
Otherwise, an old woman from the woods or the mountains could come and 
exchange a physically and mentally retarded, malformed changeling for the 
infant.  At the very least, one must place a hymnbook near the child's 
head before leaving the room.  However, if--through negligence--the 
misfortune does occur, you should take prompt notice of it.  Then you 
need only make a switch from the branches of a weeping birch tree and 
beat the changeling severely with it.  The old woman will respond to his 
cries by bringing back the exchanged child and taking the beastly child 
away.  You must allow her to depart unhindered, neither scolding nor 
cursing her, otherwise you will be left with the changeling hanging on 
your neck.
