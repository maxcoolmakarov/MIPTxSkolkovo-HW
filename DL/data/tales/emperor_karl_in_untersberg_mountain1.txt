In this marvelous mountain sits Emperor Karl, a golden crown on his head,
his scepter in his hand, and accompanied by other princely and noble
lords.  He went into a trance at Great Walserfeld, and has kept the same
form that he had during his mortal life.  His beard is grey and long,
entirely covering his golden breastplate.  On special occasions he divides
his beard into two parts, half on his right side and half on his left,
each tied with a precious pearl band.  The emperor has a keen and profound
look, and he is friendly and sociable toward all of his subjects who walk
back and forth with him across a beautiful meadow.  No one knows why he is
there and what he intends to do.  These remain mysteries of God. 
 
Franz Sartori claims that it is Emperor Karl V., but others say that it is
Frederick, who sits at a table around which his beard has grown more than
two times.  As soon as the the beard has reached the last corner of the
table for the third time, the last days of the earth will have arrived.
The Antichrist will appear; a battle will be fought on the fields at Wals;
angels will sound their trumpets; and Judgment Day will have begun.
