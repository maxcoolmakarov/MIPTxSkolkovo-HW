A variation of the story of the Wee Bannock, from Dumfriesshire, is as follows:
 
When cockle shells turned music bells,   
And turkeys chewed tobacco, 
 
And birds biggit their nests in auld men's beards, as hereafter they may do in mine -- There was an auld man and an auld wife. and they lived in a killogie. 
  
Quoth the auld man to the auld wife: "Rise, and bake me a bannock." 
  
So she rase and bakit a bannock, and set it afore the greeshoch to harden. 
  
Quoth the auld wife to the auld man: "Rise and turn the bannock." 
  
"Na, na," quoth the bannock, "I'll turn mysel'." 
  
And it turned round, and whirl't out at the door. And after it they ran, and the tane flang at it a pot, and the t'other a pan; but baith missed it . And it ran, and it ran, till it came to twa well-washers. 
  
"Welcome, welcome, wee bannockie," quo' they; "where came thou fra?"
 
I fore-ran  
A wee wee wife and a wee wee man;   
A wee wee pot and a wee wee pan;   
And sae will I you an I can. 
 
  
And they ran after't, to daud it wi' wat claes. But it ran, and it ran, till it came to twa barn-threshers. 
 
"Welcome, welcome, wee bannockie," quo' they; 'where came thou frae?"
 
I fore-ran   
A wee wee wife and a wee wee man;  
A wee wee pot and a wee wee pan;  
Twa well-washers and twa barn-threshers;  
And sae will I you an I can. 
 
 
And they ran after't wi' their flails. 
 
Thus the story goes on through a series of adventures, which are perhaps sufficiently indicated by the answer of the bannock to Tod Lowrie at last: 
 
I fore-ran  
A wee wee wife and a wee wee man;   
A wee wee pot and a wee wee pan;   
Twa well-washers and twa barn-threshers;   
Twa dike-delvers and twa heather-pu'ers;   
Twa ploughmen, twa harrowers, twa hungry herds;   
And sae will I you an I can.
 
  
But the tod snappit it a' up at ae mouthful, and that was an end o' the wee bannock.
