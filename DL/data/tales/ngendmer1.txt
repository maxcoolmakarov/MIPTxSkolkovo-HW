Once upon a time there was a girl whose task it was to spin a certain
quantity of flax every day. However, she could never complete her work.
Then one day a man came to her who promised her that he would spin the
flax for her every day if she could guess his name. But the girl could not
guess his name. Then the man went away and turned himself into a bird.
Flying happily back and forth it cried out: 
 
 
 
God is dat, god is dat, 
Dat de Diern nich weet, 
Dat ick Nägendümer heet.
 
 
It is good, it is good, 
That the girl does not know 
That my name is Nägendümer.
 
 
 
 
 A shepherd who was herding his flock nearby heard this, and he told it
to the girl. 
 Sometime later the man returned to the girl and repeated his offer. 
 She said to him, "Your name is Nägendümer!" 
 The man answered, "A bad person told you that!" But he kept his
promise, and from then on he spun all her flax every day.
