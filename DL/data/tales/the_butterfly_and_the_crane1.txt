The butterfly challenged the crane to fly to Tonga, tempting him to do so 
by asking if he was fond of shrimps. The butterfly kept resting on the 
crane's back, without the crane knowing it, and whenever the bird looked 
round and said to himself, "That lowborn fellow is gone. I can rest and 
fly slowly now, without fear of his overtaking me."   
The butterfly would leave his back and fly a little way ahead, saying, 
"Here I am, cousin," till the poor bird died exhausted; and the butterfly, 
who had no longer his back to rest on, perished also.
