High water and ice on the Haun River so damaged a miller's spillway every
winter that he was no longer able to raise the funds to repair it. 
Dismayed, one day he was standing at the spillway when he was approached
by a drunkard who offered him advice.  He promised to make the spillway so
secure that it would never again be damaged, but the miller would have to
pay him well. 
The miller agreed, and the drunkard said, "Find a boy for us.  We will
bury him alive beneath the foundation stone, and I guarantee the
durability of the spillway." 
The miller shuddered, but when the drunkard offered to provide a boy for
fifteen pecks of groats, he entered into the agreement, and forthwith they
dug the grave. 
The next day the child cried in vain.  The two men pushed him into the
pit, threw stones in on top of him, and soon the spillway was ready. 
Soon thereafter the drunkard's corpse was pulled from the Haun River.  The
miller's conscience so gnawed at him that he wasted away and then died. 
From that time forth the miller wanders about, attempting to pull
passersby into the river.  Every year he must lure at least one person
into the river.  Usually they are drunkards.  He is on the lookout for
them, because it was one of their kind who brought misfortune upon him.
