Stall 
 
Oral, from Bergkirchen 
The chief steward of a farm in the vicinity of Bergkirchen had been 
plagued with misfortune for some time. Many horses were dying, and no one 
knew why. One day his wife was standing at the hearth baking a pancake 
when a little man approached her and said that their horse stall, which 
was directly above the dwelling of the underground people, was causing the 
misfortune. If they would move it, everything would go well with them.   
The chief steward immediately moved the horses to another location. To 
thank him, the underground people invited him to stand as godparent [for 
one of their children]. Arriving underground, he was shown the place where 
the drippings from his manure pile formerly had fallen onto their table, 
and they thanked him that he now had moved it.   
In parting they gave him a few handfuls of floor sweepings. When he 
returned above ground they turned into pure gold.
