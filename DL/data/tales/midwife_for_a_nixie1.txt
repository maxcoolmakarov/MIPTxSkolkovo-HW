A midwife in Westerhausen was sitting one evening at home when someone 
knocked on her window and shouted that she should come outside. She did 
so, and there stood a nix, who told her to follow him. They walked to the 
Beck [a deep pond near Westerhausen], and the nix took a rod and struck 
the water with it. The water separated, and with dry feet they walked to 
the bottom.   
Here the woman helped the nix's wife deliver a child. To thank the 
midwife, the nixie told her that when the nix asked her how she should be 
paid, instead of money, she should ask for some of the sweepings.   
Then the midwife bathed the new baby, and while doing so she heard the 
nix's other children -- there were five of them -- running around and 
asking their father, "Shall we pinch her? Shall we pinch her?" But the 
father told them not to.   
When the midwife was finished the nix asked, "What shall I pay you?"   
Following the wife's advice, she requested some of the sweepings from 
behind the door.   
"God told you to say that," said the nix, giving her what she wanted. Then 
he took her back home, and when she looked at the sweepings, they had 
turned to pure gold.
