A famous master builder and his journeyman, while building the Bamberg
Cathedral's tower and the Bamberg Bridge, entered into a wager which could
finish first. When the master was almost finished, the journeyman was
still far behind, so the latter made a pact with the devil, that he should
quickly build the bridge. In return, the devil would receive the first
living being to cross the bridge. 
 The devil quickly went to work and was finished within a short time.
Then the journeyman fetched a rooster and chased it across the bridge. The
devil angrily departed with it. 
 The master builder of the tower was so irritated with the early
completion of the bridge that in his dismay he threw himself from the
tower.
