A farmer's wife who lived at the Nant, in the parish of 
Llaniestin, was frequently visited by a fairy who used to borrow 
 paddett a gradett  [a round flat iron and a pan used for 
baking] from her. These she used to get, and she returned them 
with a loaf borne on her head in acknowledgement. But one day 
she came to ask for the loan of her  troett bach , or wheel 
for spinning flax. When handing her this, the farmer's wife wished 
to know her name, as she came so often, but she refused to tell 
her. However, she was watched at her spinning, and overheard 
singing to the whir of the wheel:
 
 
 
 Bychan a wy√∞a' hi 
Mai Sili go Dwt  
Yw f'enw i. 
 
 Little did she know 
That Silly go Dwt  
Is my name.
