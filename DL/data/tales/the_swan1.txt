The swan is said to sing but once in its life -- when it knows that it is 
about to die. A certain man who had heard of 

the song of the swan one day saw one of these birds for sale in the 
market, and bought it and took it home with him. A 

few days later he had some friends to dinner, and produced the swan, and 
bade it sing for their entertainment; but the 

swan remained silent. In course of time, when it was growing old, it 
became aware of its approaching end and broke 

into a sweet, sad song. When its owner heard it, he said angrily, "If the 
creature only sings when it is about to die, 

what a fool I was that day I wanted to hear its song! I ought to have 
wrung its neck instead of merely inviting it to 

sing."
