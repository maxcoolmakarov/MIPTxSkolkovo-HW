A most true discourse, 
declaring the life and death of one 
Stubbe Peeter, being a most 
wicker sorcerer. 
 
Those whom the Lord doth leave to follow the imagination of their own
hearts, despising his proffered grace, in the end through the hardness of
heart and contempt of his fatherly mercy, they enter the right path to
perdition and destruction of body and soul for ever: as in this present
history in perfect sort may be seen, the strangeness whereof, together
with the cruelties committed, and the long time therein continued, may
drive many in doubt whether the same be truth or no, and the rather fore
that sundry false and fabulous matters have heretofore passed in print,
which hath wrought much incredulity in the hearts of all men generally,
insomuch that now of days few things do escape be it never so certain, but
that it is embased by the term of a lie or false report. 
In the reading of this story, therefore I do first request reformation of
opinion, next patience to peruse it, because it is published for example's
sake, and lastly to censure thereof as reason and wisdom doth think
convenient, considering the subtlety that Satan useth to work the soul's
destruction, and the great matters which the accursed practice of sorcery
doth effect, the fruits whereof is death and destruction for ever, and yet
in all ages practiced by the reprobate and wicked of the earth, some in
one sort and some in another even as the Devil giveth promise to perform.
But of all other that ever lived, none was comparable unto this Hell
hound, whose tyranny and cruelty did well declare he was of his father the
devil, who was a murderer from the beginning, whose life and death and
most bloody practices the discourse doth make just report. 
In the towns of Cperadt and Bedbur near Collin in high Germany, there was
continually brought up and nourished one Stubbe Peeter, who from his youth
was greatly inclined to evil and the practicing of wicked arts even from
twelve years of age till twenty, and so forwards till his dying day,
insomuch that surfeiting in the damnable desire of magic, necromancy, and
sorcery, acquainting himself with many infernal spirits and fiends,
insomuch tat forgetting the God that made him, and that Savior that shed
his blood man man's redemption:   In the end, careless of salvation gave
both soul and body to the Devil for ever, for small carnal pleasure in
this life, that he might be famous and spoken of on earth, though he lost
heaven thereby. 
The Devil, who hath a ready ear to listen to the lewd motions of cursed
men, promised to give him whatsoever his heart desired during his mortal
life: whereupon this vile wretch neither desired riches nor promotion, nor
was his fancy satisfied with any external or outward pleasure, but having
a tyrannous heart and a most cruel bloody mind, requested that at his
pleasure he might work his malice on men, women, and children, in the
shape of some beast, whereby he might live without dread or danger of
life, and unknown to be the executor of any bloody enterprise which he
meant to commit.   
The Devil, who saw him a fit instrument to perform mischief as a wicked
fiend pleased with the desire of wrong and destruction, gave unto him a
girdle which, being put around him, he was straight transformed into the
likeness of a greedy, devouring wolf, strong and mighty, with eyes great
and large, which in the night sparkled like unto brands of fire, a mouth
great and wide, with most sharp and cruel teeth, a huge body and mighty
paws.  And no sooner should he put off the same girdle, but presently he
should appear in his former shape, according to the proportion of a man,
as if he had never been changed. 
Stubbe Peeter herewith was exceedingly well pleased, and the shape fitted
his fancy and agreed best with his nature, being inclined to blood and
cruelty.  Therefore, satisfied with this strange and devilish gift, for
that it was not troublesome nor great in carriage, but that it might be
hidden in a small room, he proceeded to the execution of sundry most
heinous and vile murders; for if any person displeased him, he would
incontinent thirst for revenge, and no sooner should they or any of theirs
walk abroad in the fields or about the city, but in the shape of a wolf he
would presently encounter them, and never rest till he had plucked out
their throats and tear their joints asunder.  And after he had gotten a
taste hereof, he took such pleasure and delight in shedding of blood, that
he would night and day walk the fields and work extreme cruelties.  And
sundry times he would go through the streets of Collin, Bedbur, and
Cperadt, in comely habit, and very civilly, as one well known to all the
inhabitants thereabout, and oftentimes was he saluted of those whose
friends and children he had butchered, though nothing suspected for the
same.  In these places, I say, he would walk up and down, and if he could
spy either maid, wife, or child that his eyes liked or his heart lusted
after, he would wait their issuing out of the city or town.  If he could
by any means get them alone, he would in the fields ravish them, and after
in his wolfish likeness cruelly murder them.   
Yea, often it came to pass that as he walked abroad in the fields, if he
chanced to spy a company of maidens playing together or else a milking
their kine, in his wolfish shape he would incontinent run among them, and
while the rest escaped by flight, he would be sure to lay hold of one, and
after his filthy lust fulfilled, he would murder her presently.  Beside,
if he had liked or known any of them, look who he had a mind unto, her he
would pursue, whether she were before or behind, and take her from the
rest, for such was his swiftness of foot while he continued a wolf that he
would outrun the swiftest greyhound in that country; and so much he had
practiced this wickedness that the whole province was feared by the
cruelty of this bloody and devouring wolf.   
Thus continuing his devilish and damnable deeds within the compass of a
few years, he had murdered thirteen young children, and two goodly young
women big with child, tearing the children out of their wombs, in most
bloody and savage sort, and after ate their hearts panting hot and raw,
which he accounted dainty morsels and best agreeing to his appetite. 
Moreover, he used many times to kill lambs and kids and such like beasts,
feeding on the same most usually raw and bloody, as if he had been a
natural wolf indeed, so that all men mistrusted nothing less than this his
devilish sorcery. 
He had at that time living a fair young damsel to his daughter, after whom
he also lusted must unnaturally, and cruelly committed most wicked incest
with her, a most gross and vile sin, far surmounting adultery or
fornication, though the least of the three doth drive the soul into hell
fire, except hearty repentance, and the great mercy of God.  This daughter
of his he begot when he was not altogether so wickedly given, who was
called by the name of Stubbe Beell, whose beauty and good grace was such
as deserved commendations of all those that knew her.  And such was his
inordinate lust and filthy desire toward her, that he begat a child by
her, daily using her as his concubine; but as an insatiate and filthy
beast, given over to work evil, with greediness he also lay by his own
sister, frequenting her company long time, even according as the
wickedness of his heart led him.   
Moreover, being on a time sent for to a gossip of his there to make merry
and good cheer, ere he thence departed he so won the woman by his fair and
flattering speech, and so much prevailed, that ere he departed the house,
he lay by her, and ever after had her company at his command.  This woman
had to name Katherine Trompin, a woman of tall and comely stature of
exceeding good favor and one that was well esteemed among her neighbors.
But his lewd and inordinate lust being not satisfied with the company of
many concubines, nor his wicked fancy contented with the beauty of any
woman, at length the Devil sent unto him a wicked spirit in the similitude
and likeness of a woman, so fair of face and comely of personage, that she
resembled rather some heavenly Helfin than any mortal creature, so far her
beauty exceeded the choicest sort of women; and with her, as with his
heart's delight, he kept company the space of seven years, though in the
end she proved and was found indeed no other than a she-Devil.  
Notwithstanding, this lewd sin of lechery did not any thing assuage his
cruel and bloody mind, but continuing an insatiable bloodsucker, so great
was the joy he took therein, that he accounted no day spent in pleasure
wherein he had not shed some blood, not respecting so much who he did
murder, as how to murder and destroy them, as the matter ensuing doth
manifest, which may stand for a special note of a cruel and hard heart.
For, having a proper youth to his son, begotten in the flower and strength
of his age, the first fruit of his body, in whom he took such joy that he
did commonly call him his heart's ease, yet so far his delight in murder
exceeded the joy he took in his son, that thirsting after his blood, on a
time he enticed him into the fields, and from thence into a forest hard
by, where, making excuse to stay about the necessaries of nature, while
the young man went forward, incontinent in the shape and likeness of a
wolf he encountered his own son and there most cruelly slew him, which
done, he presently ate the brains out of his head as a most savory and
dainty delicious mean to staunch his greedy appetite: the most monstrous
act that ever man heard of, for never was known a wretch from nature so
far degenerate. 
Long time he continued his vile and villainous life, sometime in the
likeness of a wolf, sometime in the habit of a man, sometime in the towns
and cities, and sometimes in the woods and thickets to them adjoining,
whereas the Dutch copy maketh mention, he on a time met with two men and
one woman, whom he greatly desired to murder, and the better to bring his
devilish purpose to effect, doubting by them to be overmatched and knowing
one of them by name, he used this policy to bring them to their end.  In
subtle sort he conveyed himself far before them in their way and craftily
couched out of the sight; but as soon as they approached near the place
where he lay, he called one of them by his name.  The party, hearing
himself called once or twice by his name, supposing it was some familiar
friend that in jesting sort stood out of his sight, went from his company
toward the place from whence the voice proceeded, of purpose to see who it
was; but he was no sooner entered within the danger of this transformed
man, but incontinent he was murdered in the place; the rest of his company
staying for him, expecting still his return, but finding his stay over
long, the other man left the woman and went to look him, by which means
the second man was also murdered.  The woman then seeing neither of both
return again, in heart suspected that some evil had fallen upon them, and
therefore, with all the power she had, she sought to save herself by
flight, though it nothing prevailed, for, good soul, she was also soon
overtaken by this light-footed wolf, whom, when he had first deflowered,
he after most cruelly murdered.  The men were after found mangled in the
wood, but the woman's body was never after seen, for she the caitiff had
most ravenously devoured, whose flesh he esteemed both sweet and dainty in
taste. 
Thus this damnable Stubbe Peeter lived the term of five and twenty years,
unsuspected to be author of so many cruel and unnatural murders, in which
time he had destroyed and spoiled an unknown number of men, women, and
children, sheep, lambs, and goats, and other cattle; for, when he could
not through the wariness of people draw men, women, or children in his
danger, then, like a cruel and tyrannous beast, he would work his cruelty
on brute beasts in most savage sort, and did act more mischief and cruelty
than would be credible, although high Germany hath been forced to taste
the truth thereof. 
By which means the inhabitants of Collin, Bedbur, and Cperadt, seeing
themselves so grievously endangered, plagued, and molested by this greedy
and cruel wolf, who wrought continual harm and mischief, insomuch that few
or none durst travel to or from those places without good provision of
defense, and all for fear of this devouring and fierce wolf, for
oftentimes the inhabitants found the arms and legs of dead men, women, and
children scattered up and down the fields, to their great grief and
vexation of heart, knowing the same to be done by that strange and cruel
wolf, whom by no means they could take or overcome, so that if any man or
woman missed their child, they were out of hope ever to see it again
alive, mistrusting straight that the wolf had destroyed it. 
And here is to be noted a most strange thing which setteth forth the great
power and merciful providence of God to the comfort of each Christian
heart.  There were not long ago certain small children playing in a meadow
together hard by the town, where also some store of kine were feeding,
many of them having young calves sucking upon them. And suddenly among
these children comes this vile wolf running and caught a pretty fine girl
by the collar, with intent to pull out her throat; but such was the will
of God, that the wolf could not pierce the collar of the child's coat,
being high and very well stiffened and close clasped about her neck; and
therewithal the sudden great cry of the rest of the children which escaped
so amazed the cattle feeding by, that being fearful to be robbed of their
young, they altogether came running against the wolf with such force that
he was presently compelled to let go his hold and to run away to escape
the danger of their horns; by which means the child was preserved from
death, and, God be thanked, remains living at this day. 
An that this thing is true, Master Tice Artine, a brewer dwelling at
Puddlewharfe in London, being a man of that country born, and one of good
reputation and account, is able to justify, who is near kinsman to this
child, and hath from thence twice received letters concerning the same;
and for that the first letter did rather drive him into wondering at the
act then yielding credit thereunto, he had shortly after, at request of
his writing, another letter sent him, whereby he was more fully satisfied;
and divers other persons of great credit in London hath in like sort
received letters from their friends to the like effect. 
Likewise in the town of Germany aforesaid continual prayer was used unto
God that it would please Him to deliver them from the danger of this
greedy wolf. 
And, although they had practiced all the means that men could devise to
take this ravenous beast, yet until the Lord had determined his fall, they
could not in any wise prevail: notwithstanding, they daily continued their
purpose, and daily sought to entrap him, and for that intent continually
maintained great mastiffs and dogs of much strength to hunt and chase the
beast.  In the end, it pleased God, as they were in readiness and provided
to meet with him, that they should espy him in his wolfish likeness at
what time they beset him round about, and most circumspectly set their
dogs upon him, in such sort that there was no means of escape, at which
advantage they never could get him before; but as the Lord delivered
Goliath into the hands of David, so was this wolf brought in danger of
these men, who seeing, as I said before, no way to escape the imminent
danger, being hardly pursued at the heels, presently slipped his girdle
from about him, whereby the shape of a wolf clean avoided, and he appeared
presently in his true shape and likeness, having in his hand a staff as
one walking toward the city.  But the hunters, whose eyes were steadfastly
bent upon the beast, and seeing him in the same place metamorphosed
contrary to their expectation, it wrought a wonderful amazement to their
minds; and, had it not been that they knew the man so soon as they saw
him, they had surely taken the same to have been some Devil in a man's
likeness; but for as much as they knew him to be an ancient dweller in the
town, they came unto him, and talking with him, they brought him by
communication home to his own house, and finding him to be the man indeed,
and no delusion or fantastical motion, they had him incontinent before the
magistrates to be examined. 
Thus being apprehended, he was shortly after put to the rack in the town
of Bedbur, but fearing the torture, he voluntarily confessed his whole
life, and made known the villainies which he had committed for the space
of 25 years; also he confessed how by sorcery he procured of the Devil a
girdle, which being put on, he forthwith became a wolf, which girdle at
his apprehension he confessed he cast it off in a certain valley and there
left it, which, when the magistrates heard, they sent to the valley for
it, but at their coming found nothing at all, for it may be supposed that
it was gone to the Devil from whence it came, so that it was not to be
found.  For the Devil having brought the wretch to all the shame he could,
left him to endure the torments which his deeds deserved. 
After he had some space been imprisoned, the magistrates found out through
due examination of the matter, that his daughter Stubbe Beell and his
gossip Katherine Trompin were both accessory to divers murders committed,
who for the same as also for their lewd life otherwise committed, was
arraigned, and with Stubbe Peeter condemned, and their several judgments
pronounced the 28 of October 1589, in this manner, that is to say:  Stubbe
Peeter as principal malefactor, was judged first to have his body laid on
a wheel, and with red hot burning pincers in ten several places to have
the flesh pulled off from the bones, after that, his legs and arms to be
broken with a wooden ax or hatchet, afterward to have his head struck from
his body, then to have his carcass burned to ashes. 
Also his daughter and his gossip were judged to be burned quick to ashes,
the same time and day with the carcass of the aforesaid Stubbe Peeter.
And on the 31st of the same month, they suffered death accordingly in the
town of Bedbur in the presence of many peers and princes of Germany. 
This, Gentle Reader, have I set down the true discourse of this wicked man
Stub Peeter, which I desire to be a warning to all sorcerers and witches,
which unlawfully follow their own devilish imagination to the utter ruin
and destruction of their souls eternally, from which wicked and damnable
practice, I beseech God keep all good men, and from the cruelty of their
wicked hearts.  Amen 
After the execution, there was by the advice of the magistrates of the
town of Bedbur a high pole set up and strongly framed, which first went
through the wheel whereon he was  broken, whereunto also it was fastened;
after that a little above the wheel the likeness of a wolf was framed in
wood, to show unto all men the shape wherein he executed those cruelties.
Over that on the top of the stake the sorcerer's head itself was set up,
and round about the wheel there hung as it were sixteen pieces of wood
about a yard in length with represented the sixteen persons that was
perfectly known to be murdered by him. And the same ordained to stand
there 
 for a continual monument to all ensu- 
ing ages, what murders by Stub Pee- 
ter was committed, with the or- 
der of his judgment, as 
this picture doth more 
plainly ex- 
press.
