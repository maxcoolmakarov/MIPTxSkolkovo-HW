Version 1 
 Once on a time there was a boy named Jack, and one morning he started
to go and seek his fortune. He hadn't gone very far before he met a
cat. 
 "Where are you going, Jack?" said the cat. 
 "I am going to seek my fortune." 
 "May I go with you?" 
 "Yes," said Jack, "the more the merrier." 
 So on they went, jiggelty-jolt, jiggelty-jolt. 
 They went a little further and they met a dog. 
 "Where are you going, Jack?" said the dog. 
 "I am going to seek my fortune." 
 "May I go with you?" 
 "Yes," said Jack, "the more the merrier." 
 So on they went, jiggelty-jolt, jiggelty-jolt. 
 They went a little further and they met a goat, 
 "Where are you going, Jack?" said the goat. 
 "I am going to seek my fortune." 
 "May I go with you?" 
 "Yes," said Jack, "the more the merrier." 
 So on they went, jiggelty-jolt, jiggelty-jolt. 
 They went a little further and they met a bull. 
 "Where are you going, Jack?" said the bull. 
 "I am going to seek my fortune." 
 "May I go with you?" 
 "Yes," said Jack, "the more the merrier." 
 So on they went, jiggelty-jolt, jiggelty-jolt. 
 They went a little further and they met a skunk. 
 "Where are you going, Jack?" said the skunk. 
 "May I go with you?" 
 "Yes," said Jack, "the more the merrier." 
 So on they went, jiggelty-jolt, jiggelty-jolt. 
 They went a little further and they met a rooster. 
 "Where are you going, Jack?" said the rooster. 
 "I am going to seek my fortune." 
 "May I go with you?" 
 "Yes," said Jack, "the more the merrier." 
 So on they went, jiggelty-jolt, jiggelty-jolt. 
 Well, they went on till it was about dark, and they began to think of
some place where they could spend the night. About this time they came in
sight of a house, and Jack told them to keep still while he went up a
looked in through the window. And there were some robbers counting over
their money. Then Jack went back and told them to wait till he gave the
word, and then to make all the noise they could. So when they were all
ready Jack gave the word, and the cat mewed, and the dog barked, and the
goat blatted, and the bull bellowed, and the rooster crowed, and all
together they made such a dreadful noise that it frightened the robbers
all away. 
 And then they went in a took possession of the house. Jack was afraid
the robbers would come back in the night, and so when it came time to go
to bed he put the cat in the rocking-chair, and he put the dog under the
table, and he put the goat upstairs, and he put the bull down cellar, and
he put the skunk in the corner of the fireplace, and the rooster flew up
onto the roof, and Jack went to bed. 
 By and by the robbers saw it was all dark, and they sent one man back
to the house to look after their money. Before long he came back in a
great fright and told them his story. 
 "I went back to the house," said he, "and went in an tried to sit down
in the rocking-chair, and there was an old woman knitting, and she stuck
her knitting needles into me. I went to the table to look after the money,
and there was a shoemaker under the table, and he stuck his awl into me. I
started to go upstairs, and there was a man up there threshing, and he
knocked me down with his flail. I started to go down cellar, and there was
a man down there chopping wood, and he knocked me up with his axe. I went
to warm me at the fireplace, and there was an old woman washing dishes,
and she threw her dishwater onto me. But I shouldn't have minded all that
if it hadn't been for that little fellow on top of the house, who kept a
hollering, 'Toss him up to me-e! Toss him up to me-e!'"
