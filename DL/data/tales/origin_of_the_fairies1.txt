In our Savior's time there lived a woman whose fortune it was to be 
possessed of nearly a score of children, and as she saw our blessed Lord 
approach her dwelling, being ashamed of being so prolific, and that he 
might not see them all, she concealed about half of them closely, and 
after his departure, when she went in search of them, to her great 
surprise found they were all gone. They never afterwards could be 
discovered, for it was supposed that as a punishment from heaven for 
hiding what God had given her, she was deprived of them; and it is said 
these her offspring have generated the race called fairies.
