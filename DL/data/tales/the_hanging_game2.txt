In WÃ¼renlos [in the canton of Aargau] the village boys idling in the meadow were talking about a game that they might play until the end of the long day. Because they could think of nothing new, they decided that the one of them who always lost at their previous games should let himself be hanged for a short while as a penalty. He agreed, under the condition that they would immediately help him as soon as he let his feet swing. He climbed a nearby willow tree and let them tie him to a branch.   
At that same moment a magnificent bird with glistening feathers flew out of the willow tree.  The boys who first saw it chased after it, and the others heard music that was so seductively tempting that they ran to the place where the sound seemed to be coming from. When both groups disappointedly returned to the meadow, their comrade was hanging motionless from the cord.
