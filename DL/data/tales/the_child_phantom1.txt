Many years ago there died on the estate of Sundshult, in the parish of
Nafverstad, a child of illegitimate birth, which, because of this, was not
christened and could not be accorded Christian burial, or a place in
heaven, and whose spirit, therefore, was left to wander the earth,
disturbing the rest and making night uncomfortable for the people of the
neighborhood. 
 One time, just before Christmas, the parish shoemaker, on his rounds,
was detained at the house of a patron, and, having much work before him,
he was still sewing late into the night, when he was unexpectedly startled
from his employment by a little child appearing before him, which said,
"Why do you sit there? Move aside." 
 "For what?" asked the shoemaker. 
 "Because I wish to dance," said the specter. 
 "Dance away, then!" said the shoemaker. 
 When the child had danced some time, it disappeared, but returned soon
and said, "I will dance again, and I'll dance your light out for you." 
 "No," said the shoemaker, "let the light alone. But who are you that
you are here in this manner?" 
 "I live under the lower stone of the steps to the porch." 
 "Who put you there?" asked the shoemaker. 
 "Watch when it dawns, and you will see my mother coming, wearing a red
cap. But help me out of this, and I'll never dance again." 
 This the shoemaker promised to do, and the specter vanished. 
 The next day a servant girl from the neighboring estate came, who wore
upon her head a red handkerchief.
Digging was begun under the designated step, and in time the skeleton of a
child was found, encased in a wooden tub. The body was that day taken to
the churchyard, and the mother, who had destroyed her child, turned over
to the authorities. Since then the child specter has danced no more.
