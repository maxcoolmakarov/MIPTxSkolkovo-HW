In Mellenthin there was once a girl who, while she was still alive, always
struck her mother, and after she died, her hand came out of her grave.
However often the Mellenthin peasants reburied it, it came out again.
Finally they cut it off, and since the Mellenthin church was just being
built, they put a stone behind the altar, and laid the hand under it, and
it is lying there still.
