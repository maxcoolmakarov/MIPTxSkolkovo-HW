Land's-End 
 
At a short distance from Sennen church, and near the end of a cottage, is
a block of granite, nearly eight feet long, and about three feet high.
This rock is known as the Table-mên, or Table- main , which
appears to signify the stone-table. 
At Bosavern, in St. Just, is a somewhat similar flat stone; and the same
story attaches to each. 
It is to the effect that some Saxon Kings used the stone as a dining
table.  The number has been variously stated; some traditions fixing on
three kings, others on seven.  Hals is far more explicit; for, as he says,
on the authority of the chronicle of Samuel Daniell; they were -- 
 
Ethelbert, 5th king of Kent; 
Cissa, 2d king of the South Saxons; 
Kingills, 6th king of the West Saxons; 
Sebert, 3d king of the East Saxons; 
Ethelfred, 7th king of the Northumbers; 
Penda, 5th king of the Mercians; 
Sigebert, 5th king of the East Angles, -- all who flourished about the
year 600. 
 
At a point where the four parishes of Zennor, Morvah, Gulval, and Madron
meet, is a flat stone with a cross cut on it.  The Saxon kings are also
said to have dined on this. 
The only tradition which is known amongst the peasantry of Sennen is, that
Prince Arthur and the Kings who aided him against the Danes, in the great
battle fought near Vellan-Drucher, dined on the Table-mên,
after which they defeated the Danes.
