A rich man was in the habit of giving his old father kanji (rice-water) out of a broken pot. One day his little boy took this pot and hid it.  
Some time after, this hard-hearted man began to beat his father because he could not find the pot, whereupon the little boy called out, "O father, don't beat my grandfather, for I have taken away the pot and hidden it. You know after I have become a great man I shall not buy any other pot for you."  
Hearing this the man was ashamed, and from that day he provided every needful comfort for his father.
