A country nurse, to fright her babe to peace,  
Said, "Wolf shall have thee, or thy cries must cease."  
The wolf o'erheard, believed the scolding crone,  
And stay'd in hopes to find the feast his own.  
But evening came; the babe was hush'd to rest:  
The wolf still gaped, with rav'ning hunger prest.  
At last his hopes to utter dulness grew:  
Then to his anxious helpmate he withdrew.  
"How cam'st thou empty?" said she. He replied,  
"Because upon a female I relied."
