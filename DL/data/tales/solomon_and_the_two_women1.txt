Then came there two women, that were harlots, unto King Solomon, and
stood before him. And the one woman said, "Oh my lord, I and this woman
dwell in one house; and I was delivered of a child with her in the house.
And it came to pass the third day after that I was delivered, that this
woman was delivered also: and we were together; there was no stranger with
us in the house, save we two in the house. And this woman's child died in
the night; because she overlaid it. And she arose at midnight, and took my
son from beside me, while thine handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom,
and laid her dead child in my bosom. And when I rose in the morning to
give my child suck, behold, it was dead: but when I had considered it in
the morning, behold, it was not my son, which I did bear." 
 And the other woman said, "Nay; but the living is my son, and the dead
is thy son." 
 And this said, "No; but the dead is thy son, and the living is my son."
Thus they spake before the king. 
 Then said the king, "The one saith, 'This is my son that liveth, and
thy son is the dead'; and the other saith, 'Nay; but thy son is the dead,
and my son is the living.'" And the king said, "Bring me a sword." And
they brought a sword before the king. And the king said, "Divide the
living child in two, and give half to the one, and half to the other." 
 Then spake the woman whose the living child was unto the king, for her
bowels yearned upon her son, and she said, "Oh my lord, give her the
living child, and in no wise slay it."  
 But the other said, "Let it be neither mine nor thine, but divide
it." 
 Then the king answered and said, "Give her the living child, and in no
wise slay it: she is the mother thereof." 
 And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged; and
they feared the king: for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him, to
do judgment.
