A hare was one day making fun of a tortoise for being so slow upon his 
feet. "Wait a bit," said the tortoise. "I'll run a race with you, and I'll 
wager that I win."   
"Oh, well," replied the hare, who was much amused at the idea, "let's try 
and see."   
And it was soon agreed that the fox should set a course for them and be 
the judge. When the time came both started off together, but the hare was 
soon so far ahead that he thought he might as well have a rest. So down he 
lay and fell fast asleep. Meanwhile the tortoise kept plodding on, and in 
time reached the goal. At last the hare woke up with a start and dashed on 
at his fastest, but only to find that the tortoise had already won the 
race. 
 
Slow and steady wins the race.
