A peasant in Holl had a servant girl whom no one knew. She was very
industrious and well behaved, but she would not say what her name was. 
 One day the man was carrying a yoke home from the field when the voice
of an unseen person called out to him several times, "You, the man
carrying the yoke, tell Gloria that the chancellor has died." 
 The man did not think about this occurance until suppertime, and then
he related it to the girl, adding that he now knew that her name was
Gloria. The girl immediately jumped head over heels and fled. And no one
has seen her since then.
