Was a little girl named Katie; and an old woman lived in a house by
herself, and everybody believed she was a witch. As Katie was passin'
by, the old woman opened the door and told her to come in, and the little girl went in and saw a beautiful room with lots of pretty pictures;
and the old woman said she would give her some apples to eat.   
And
after she finished eating the apples, the old woman told her to stay
with her all the time. An' then Katie remembered that her mother
sent her on an errand to get something for supper. She told the ol'
woman that she would stay, but she had to get something for her
mother for supper, else she wouldn' have anything.   
An' she told her
she could have anything she wanted; and she took a wand and hit
the table, an' in Katie's mother's house there came lots of good things,
and she was wonderin' where they came from. And Katie 'greed to
stay with her for a week.   
An' at the end of the week she had a dream.
She dreamed that a elf came and told her that the witch was goin' to
kill her. The next night she dreamed the same thing. The elf left
her a comb and a handkerchief, and told her to drop them when the
witch came after her.   
She jumped out the window in the middle of
the night; and as she was almos' nearin' home, she looked behind and
saw the witch comin' after her. So she dropped her comb, an' a fores'
grew up; and it took the witch a long time to get through. Then, after
she got through, Katie dropped her handkerchief, and a river came. An'
the witch had to cross the river. As she was almos' home, she came to
a woods where a wood-cutter was cuttin' down some trees.   
The woodcutter saw the witch, so he cut off her haid. He took Katie home.
And her mother told her that came of children that disobeyed.
