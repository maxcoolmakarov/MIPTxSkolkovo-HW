In the ancient monastery of Miidera there was a great bronze bell.  It 
rang out every morning and evening, a clear, rich note, and its surface 
shone like sparkling dew.  The priests would not allow any woman to 
strike it, because they thought that such an action would pollute and 
dull the metal, as well as bring calamity upon them. 
When a certain pretty woman who lived in Kyoto heard this, she grew 
extremely inquisitive, and at last, unable to restrain her curiosity, she 
said: "I will go and see this wonderful bell of Miidera.  I will make it 
send forth a soft note, and in its shining surface, bigger and brighter 
than a thousand mirrors, I will paint and powder my face and dress my 
hair." 
At length this vain and irreverent woman reached the belfry in which the 
great bell was suspended, at a time when all were absorbed in their 
sacred duties.  She looked into the gleaming bell and saw her pretty 
eyes, flushed cheeks, and laughing dimples.  Presently she stretched 
forth her little fingers, lightly touched the shining metal, and prayed 
that she might have as great and splendid a mirror for her own.  When the 
bell felt this woman's fingers, the bronze that she touched shrank, 
leaving a little hollow, and losing at the same time all its exquisite 
polish.
