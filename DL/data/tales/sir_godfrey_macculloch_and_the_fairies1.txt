The Scottish Fairies, in like manner, sometimes reside in subterranean 
abodes, in the vicinity of human habitations, or, according to the popular 
phrase, under the "door-stane," or threshold; in which situation, they 
sometimes establish an intercourse with men, by borrowing and lending, and 
other kindly offices. In this capacity they are termed "the good 
neighbors," from supplying privately the wants of their friends, and 
assisting them in all their transactions, while their favors are 
concealed. Of this the traditionary story of Sir Godfrey Macculloch forms 
a curious example.   
As this Gallovidian gentleman was taking the air on horseback, near his 
own house, he was suddenly accosted by a little old man, arrayed in green, 
and mounted upon a white palfrey. After mutual salutation, the old man 
gave Sir Godfrey to understand, that he resided under his habitation, and 
that he had great reason to complain of the direction of a drain, or 
common sewer, which emptied itself directly into his chamber of dais.*   
Sir Godfrey Macculloch was a good deal startled at this extraordinary 
complaint; but, guessing the nature of the being he had to deal with, he 
assured the old man, with great courtesy, that the direction of the drain 
should be altered; and caused it to be done accordingly.   
Many years afterwards, Sir Godfrey had the misfortune to kill, in a fray, 
a gentleman of the neighborhood. He was apprehended, tried, and 
condemned.â€  The scaffold, upon which his head was to be struck off, 
was erected on the Castle-Hill of Edinburgh; but hardly had he reached the 
fatal spot, when the old man, upon his white palfrey, pressed through the 
crowd, with the rapidity of lightning. Sir Godfrey, at his command, sprung 
on behind him ; the "good neighbor" spurred his horse down the steep bank, 
and neither he nor the criminal were ever again seen.
