A water snail was coming upstream from the lower reaches, when a king crow 
heard it. Said the king crow to himself, "Who can it be coming upstream, 
that exclaims so loudly at the rapids? One might say it was a man, but 
that there is nothing to be seen."   
So the king crow settled on a tree to watch, but as he could see nothing 
from his perch on the tree he flew down to the ground, and walked along by 
the waterside. And when he thought to see some man exclaiming, he caught 
sight of the water snail.   
"Hullo, you there," said he, "where do you come from?"   
"I come from the eddy below the rapids," said the water snail, "and I only 
want to get as far as the headwaters of this river."   
Said the king crow, "Wait a bit. Suppose you go down to the river mouth as 
quickly as you can, and we will have a wager on it." (Now rivers are the 
water snail's domain, in which he has many comrades.)   
"What is to be the stake?" asked the water snail.   
"If I am beaten I will be your slave, and look after your aroids and wild 
caladiums (on which the water snails feed). Then the king crow asked, "And 
what will  you  stake?"   
The water snail replied, "If I am beaten the river shall be handed over to 
you, and you shall be king of the river."   
But the water snail begged for a delay of twice seven days, saying that he 
felt knocked up after ascending the rapids. And the delay was granted 
accordingly.   
Meanwhile however the water snail hunted up a great number of his friends 
and instructed them to conceal themselves in each of the higher reaches of 
the river, and to reply immediately when the king crow challenged them. 
  
The day arrived, and the king crow flew off, and in each of the higher 
reaches the water snail's friends replied to the challenge. And at the 
river mouth the water snail replied in person. So the king crow was 
defeated and has ever since remained the slave of the water snail.
