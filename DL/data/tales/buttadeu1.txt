It was in winter, and my good father was at Sacalone, in the warehouse,
warming himself at the fire, when he saw a man enter, dressed differently
from the people of that region, with breeches striped in yellow, red, and
black, and his cap the same way. My good father was frightened. "Oh!" he
said, "what is this person?" 
 "Do not be afraid," the man said. "I am called Buttadeu." 
 "Oh!" said my father, "I have heard you mentioned. Be pleased to sit
down a while a tell me something." 
 "I cannot sit, for I am condemned by my God always to walk." And while
he was speaking he was always walking up and down and had no rest. Then he
said: "Listen. I am going away; I leave you, in memory of me, this, that
you must say a  credo  at the right hand of our Lord, and five other
 credos  at his left, and a  salve regina  to the Virgin, for
the grief I suffer on account of her son. I salute you." 
 "Farewell." 
 "Farewell, my name is Buttadeu."
