A Yell man was grinding corn in the water mill one night. He was alone, 
and according to custom, was winding  floss  (common rush) to pass 
the time. As the grinding was likely to occupy most of the night he set 
about preparing supper. He had brought a fowl with him which he proceeded 
to roast, using the  klibbi-tengs  (fire-tongs made from a bent hoop) 
as a gridiron.  
Presently he heard the sound of music and dancing and knew that the trows 
had come. Shortly afterwards the door was quietly opened. One of them, a 
young woman, came into the mill and wanted to know the occupant's name. 
The man knew whom he had to deal with, however, and the answer he gave was 
a cautious one.  
"Mysel' i' da mill," he replied.   
The visitor, however, seemed in no hurry to depart. She went to the fire 
and touched the fowl, and afterwards approached the man and placed a hand 
on his shoulder. This rather upset his temper. He resented the 
familiarity, and seizing the sizzling fowl by its legs, he dashed it full 
in the woman's face. The latter immediately fled outside screaming with 
pain and fright.   
The music ceased, and the merrymakers crowded round their companion, and 
with anger in their voices, demanded to know how she had come by the 
injury.   
"It was mysel' i' da mill," she told them.   
On hearing this, the trows replied in chorus, "Sel' d√∂ sel' ha'e." 
  
The mirth was resumed, and the lone occupant of the mill settled down to 
his task, well satisfied that his ready wit had saved him.
