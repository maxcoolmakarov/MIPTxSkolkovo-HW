A mother came to visit her married daughter. Through the window the daughter saw her coming, and with another plate she quickly covered the roasted chicken that she and her husband were eating, then hid it so they would not have to share it with the mother.  
The mother sat for a while and then went away without being offered anything to eat. The daughter immediately fetched the chicken to continue eating it. But when she tried to pick up the top plate it had grown onto the roast. In an instant the chicken and the two plates had been transformed into a turtle.  
Thus the turtle came into being.
