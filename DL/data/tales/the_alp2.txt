The alp is a demonic being which presses upon sleeping people so that
they cannot utter a sound. These attacks are called  Alpdr√ºcke
 (nightmares). 
 A girl told how the alp came to her through a keyhole. She was not able
to call for help. Later, she therefore asked her sister to call out her
name in the night, and then the alp would go back out through the
keyhole. 
 In Zwickau they claim that the alp will go away if one invites him for
coffee the following morning. 
 It is also believed that the alp crushes animals to death. For example,
if young geese, are placed in a pig pen and then die it is said that the
alp crushed them to death. If rabbits die, and it appears that they have
been crushed, a broom is placed in their pen, which protects them against
the alp.
