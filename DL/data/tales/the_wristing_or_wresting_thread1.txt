The following charm was used for the cure of sprains.  A linen thread is
tied
around the injured part, after the solemn repetion of the charm:
 
Our Savior rade,   
His fore-foot slade;   
Our Savior lichtit down.   
Sinew to sinew, vein to vein,   
Joint to joint, and bane to bane,   
Mend thou in God's name!
 
During the time of repeating this charm nine knots must be tied on the
thread, at regular distances, and to ensure success the charm should be repeated
at every knot.
