Nasreddin Hodja had two wives, one much older than the other.  
 "Which of us do you love the most?" asked the older wife one day.  
 "I love you both the same," answered Nasreddin, wisely.  
 Not satisfied with this answer, the older wife continued, "If the two 
of us wives fell out of a boat, which one of us would you rescue first?" 
 
 "Well," replied Nasreddin, "you can swim a little, can't you?"
