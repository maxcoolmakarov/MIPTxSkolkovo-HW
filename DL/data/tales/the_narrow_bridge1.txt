Once upon a time there was a shepherd who had a large, large herd of
sheep which he was moving over hill and dale, far out into the world. They
came to a deep body of water, over which there was fortunately a bridge.
However, the bridge was tiny and narrow, so that only a single sheep could
go across it. And another sheep could not even step onto the bridge until
the sheep in front was all the way across, or the bridge certainly would
have broken. Just think how long it will take until all of the many, many
sheep have crossed over. 
 So, you see, we must wait until they are all on the other side with the
shepherd, and that will take a while yet, and then I will continue with my
story about the shepherd and his large, large herd of sheep.
