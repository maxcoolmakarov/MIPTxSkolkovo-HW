A jackdaw, watching some pigeons in a farmyard, was filled with envy
when he saw how well they were fed, and determined to disguise himself as
one of them, in order to secure a share of the good things they enjoyed.
So he painted himself white from head to foot and joined the flock. And,
so long as he was silent, they never suspected that he was not a pigeon
like themselves. But one day he was unwise enough to start chattering,
when they at once saw through his disguise and pecked him so unmercifully
that he was glad to escape and join his own kind again. But the other
jackdaws did not recognize him in his white dress, and would not let him
feed with them, but drove him away. And so he became a homeless wanderer
for his pains.
