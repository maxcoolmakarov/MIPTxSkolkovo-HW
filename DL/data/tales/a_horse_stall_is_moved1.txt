An Old Man's Tale 
In olden times there were dwarfs in Hagenburg on Lake Steinhudersee. They 
lived near a man who had his horse stall directly above their dwelling. 
One day they came to him and asked him to take his horses away, because 
"their manure falls onto our heads." Furthermore, they said that if he 
would do so his horses would thrive.  The man did this, and afterward his 
horses were the best ones in all of Hagenburg. He prospered and became a 
wealthy man.
