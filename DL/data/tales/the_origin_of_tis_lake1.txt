A troll had once taken up his abode near the village of Kund, in the high 
bank on which the church now stands; but when the people about there had 
become pious, and went constantly to church, the troll was dreadfully 
annoyed by their almost incessant ringing of bells in the steeple of the 
church. He was at last obliged, in consequence of it, to take his 
departure; for nothing has more contributed to the emigration of the troll 
folk out of the country than the increasing piety of the people, and their 
taking to bell ringing. The troll of Kund accordingly quitted the country, 
and went over to Funen, where he lived for some time in peace and quiet. 
  
Now it chanced that a man who had lately settled in the town of Kund, 
coming to Funen on business, met on the road with this same troll. "Where 
do you live?" said the troll to him.   
Now there was nothing whatever about the troll unlike a man, so he 
answered him, as was the truth, "I am from the town of Kund."   
"So?" said the troll. "I don't know you then! And yet I think I know every 
man in Kund. Will you, however," continued he, "just be so kind to take a 
letter from me back with you to Kund?"   
The man said, of course, he had no objection. The troll then thrust the 
letter into his pocket, and charged him strictly not to take it out till 
he came to Kund church, and then to throw it over the churchyard wall, and 
the person for whom it was intended would get it.   
The troll then went away in great haste, and with him the letter went 
entirely out of the man's mind. But when he was come back to Zealand he 
sat down by the meadow where Tis Lake now is, and suddenly recollected the 
troll's letter. He felt a great desire to look at it at least. So he took 
it out of his pocket, and sat a while with it in his hands, when suddenly 
there began to dribble a little water out of the seal. The letter now 
unfolded itself, and the water came out faster and faster, and it was with 
the utmost difficulty that the poor man was enabled to save his life, for 
the malicious troll had enclosed an entire lake in the letter.   
The troll, it is plain, had thought to avenge himself on Kund church by 
destroying it in this manner; but God ordered it so that the lake chanced 
to run out in the great meadow where it now flows.
