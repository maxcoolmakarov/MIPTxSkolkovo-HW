A certain man had longed all his life to look upon the Night of Power, 
and one night it befell that he gazed at the sky and saw the angels, and 
Heaven's gates thrown open; and he beheld all things prostrating 
themselves before their Lord, each in its several stead. So he said to his 
wife, "Harkye, such an one, verily Allah hath shown me the Night of Power, 
and it hath been proclaimed to me, from the invisible world, that three 
prayers will be granted unto me; so I consult thee for counsel as to what 
shall I ask." 
 Quoth she, "Oh man, the perfection of man and his delight is in his 
prickle; therefore do thou pray Allah to greaten thy yard and magnify 
it." 
 So he lifted up his hands to heaven and said, "Oh Allah, greaten my 
yard and magnify it." Hardly had he spoken when his tool became as big as 
a column and he could neither sit nor stand nor move about nor even stir 
from his stead; and when he would have carnally known his wife, she fled 
before him from place to place. So he said to her, "Oh accursed woman, 
what is to be done? This is thy list, by reason of thy lust." 
 She replied, "No, by Allah, I did not ask for this length and huge 
bulk, for which the gate of a street were too strait. Pray Heaven to make 
it less." 
 So he raised his eyes to Heaven and said, "Oh Allah, rid me of this 
thing and deliver me therefrom." And immediately his prickle disappeared 
altogether and he became clean smooth. 
 When his wife saw this she said, "I have no occasion for thee, now thou 
art become pegless as a eunuch, shaven and shorn." 
 And he answered her, saying, "All this comes of thine ill-omened 
counsel and thine imbecile judgment. I had three prayers accepted of 
Allah, wherewith I might have gotten me my good, both in this world and in 
the next, and now two wishes are gone in pure waste, by thy lewd will, and 
there remaineth but one." 
 Quoth she, "Pray Allah the Most High to restore thee thy yard as it 
was." 
 So he prayed to his Lord and his prickle was restored to its first 
estate. Thus the man lost his three wishes by the lack of wit in the 
woman.
