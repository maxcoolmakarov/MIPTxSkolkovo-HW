Now from the ambient Land we smoothly steal,  
And level ev'ry Hill with ev'ry Vale,  
The Shores frequented, whilst detain'd, we leave,  
And 'mid'st the Waters sink the lofty Cave.  
Here, as Tradition's hoary Legend tells,  
A blinking Piper once, with magic Spells,  
And Strains beyond a vulgar Bagpipe's Sound,  
Gather'd the dancing Country wide around;  
When hither as he drew the tripping Rear  
(Dreadful to think, and di?cult to swear!)  
The gaping Mountain yawn'd, from Side to Side,  
A hideous Cavern, darksome, deep and wide:  
In skipt th' exulting DÃ¦mon piping loud,  
With passive Joy suc'ceeded by the Croud;  
The winding Cavern, trembling as he play'd,  
With dreadful Echoes rung throughout it's Shade  
Then ?rm, and instant, clos'd the greedy Womb,  
Where wide-born Thousands met a common Tomb.  
Ev'n now the good Inhabitant relates,  
With serious Horror, their disastrous Fates;  
And, as the noted Spot he ventures near,  
His Fancy, strung with Tales, and shook with Fear,  
Sounds magic Concerts in his tingling Ear: 
With superstitious Awe, and solemn Face,  
Trembling he points, and thinks he points the Place.
