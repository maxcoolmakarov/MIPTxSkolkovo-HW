In the vicinity of Schöneiche not far from Rüdersdorf a group of 
people were making merry on the bank of a small pond when suddenly they 
heard someone clapping his hands and a voice calling from the water, "The 
hour is here, and the person is not here yet!" This was repeated several 
times.  
A short time later an apprentice came along the path, then hurried to the 
bank of the pond to quench his thirst. One of the merrymakers went to him 
and held him away from the water, telling him what they had heard. Thus 
the apprentice changed his mind and went with the merrymakers to a tavern 
in Schöneiche, where he ordered a glass of beer. He had scarcely 
brought it to his lips when he collapsed on the floor and died.
