A long time ago a little town made up of a collection of low huts stood
in a tiny green valley at the foot of a cliff. Of course the people had
taken great care to build their houses out of reach of the highest tide
which might be driven on shore by a west wind, but on the very edge of the
town there had sprung up a tree so large that half its boughs hung over
the huts and the other half over the deep sea right under the cliff, where
sharks loved to come and splash in the clear water. 
 The branches of the tree itself were laden with fruit, and every day at
sunrise a big gray monkey might have been seen sitting in the topmost
branches having his breakfast, and chattering to himself with delight. 
 After he had eaten all the fruit on the town side of the tree the
monkey swung himself along the branches to the part which hung over the
water. While he was looking out for a nice shady place where he might
perch comfortably, he noticed a shark watching him from below with greedy
eyes. 
 "Can I do anything for you, my friend?" asked the monkey politely. 
 "Oh! if you only would throw me down some of those delicious things, I
should be so grateful," answered the shark. "After you have lived on fish
for fifty years you begin to feel you would like a change. And I am so
very, very tired of the taste of salt." 
 "Well, I don't like salt myself," said the monkey, "so if you will open
your mouth I will throw this beautiful juicy kuyu into it," and, as he
spoke, he pulled one off the branch just over his head. But it was not so
easy to hit the shark's mouth as he supposed, even when the creature had
turned on his back, and the first kuyu only struck one of his teeth and
rolled into the water. However, the second time the monkey had better
luck, and the fruit fell right in. 
 "Ah, how good!" cried the shark. "Send me another, please," and the
monkey grew tired of picking the kuyu long before the shark was tired of
eating them. 
 "It is getting late, and I must be going home to my children," he said,
at length, "but if you are here at the same time tomorrow I will give you
another treat." 
 "Thank you, thank you," said the shark, showing all his great ugly
teeth as he grinned with delight. "You can't guess how happy you have made
me," and he swam away into the shadow, hoping to sleep away the time till
the monkey came again. 
 For weeks the monkey and the shark breakfasted together, and it was a
wonder that the tree had any fruit left for them. They became fast
friends, and told each other about their homes and their children, and how
to teach them all they ought to know. 
 By and by the monkey became rather discontented with his green house in
a grove of palms beyond the town, and longed to see the strange things
under the sea which he had heard of from the shark. The shark perceived
this very clearly, and described greater marvels. And the monkey, as he
listened, grew more and more gloomy. 
 Matters were in this state when one day the shark said, "I really
hardly know how to thank you for your kindness to me during these weeks.
Here I have nothing of my own to offer you, but if you would only consent
to come home with me, how gladly would I give you anything that might
happen to take your fancy." 
 "I should like nothing better," cried the monkey, his teeth chattering,
as they always did when he was pleased. "But how could I get there? Not by
water, Ugh! It makes me ill to think of it!" 
 "Oh! don't let that trouble you," replied the shark. "You have only to
sit on my back and I will undertake that not a drop of water shall touch
you." 
 So it was arranged, and directly after breakfast next morning the shark
swam close up under the tree, and the monkey dropped neatly on his back,
without even a splash. After a few minutes -- for at first he felt a
little frightened at his strange position -- the monkey began to enjoy
himself vastly, and asked the shark a thousand questions about the fish
and the seaweeds and the oddly shaped things that floated past them, and
as the shark always gave him some sort of answer, the monkey never guessed
that many of the objects they saw were as new to his guide as to
himself. 
 The sun had risen and set six times when the shark suddenly said, "My
friend, we have now performed half our journey, and it is time that I
should tell you something." 
 "What is it?" asked the monkey. "Nothing unpleasant, I hope, for you
sound rather grave." 
 "Oh, no! Nothing at all. It is only that shortly before we left I heard
that the sultan of my country is very ill, and that the only thing to cure
him is a monkey's heart." 
 "Poor man, I am very sorry for him," replied the monkey; "but you were
unwise not to tell me till we had started." 
 "What do you mean?" asked the shark. But the monkey, who now understood
the whole plot, did not answer at once, for he was considering what he
should say. 
 "Why are you so silent?" inquired the shark again. 
 "I was thinking what a pity it was you did not tell me while I was
still on land, and then I would have brought my heart with me." 
 "Your heart! Why isn't your heart here?" said the shark, with a puzzled
expression. 
 "Oh, no! Of course not. Is it possible you don't know that when we
leave home we always hang up our hearts on trees, to prevent their being
troublesome? However, perhaps you won't believe that, and will just think
I have invented it because I am afraid, so let us go on to your country as
fast as we can, and when we arrive you can look for my heart, and if you
find it you can kill me." 
 The monkey spoke in such a calm indifferent way that the shark was
quite deceived, and began to wish he had not been in such a hurry. 
 "But there is no use going on if your heart is not with you," he said
at last. "We had better turn back to the town, and then you can fetch
it." 
 Of course, this was just what the monkey wanted, but he was careful not
to seem too pleased. 
 "Well, I don't know," he remarked carelessly. "It is such a long way;
but you may be right." 
 "I am sure I am," answered the shark, "and I will swim as quickly as I
can," and so he did, and in three days they caught sight of the kuyu tree
hanging over the water. 
 With a sigh of relief the monkey caught hold of the nearest branch and
swung himself up. 
 "Wait for me here," he called out to the shark. "I am so hungry I must
have a little breakfast, and then I will go and look for my heart," and he
went further and further into the branches so that the shark could not see
him. Then he curled himself up and went to sleep. 
 "Are you there?" cried the shark, who was soon tired of swimming about
under the cliff, and was in haste to be gone. 
 The monkey awoke with a start, but did not answer. 
 "Are you  there ?" called the shark again, louder than before, and
in a very cross voice. 
 "Oh, yes. I am here," replied the monkey; "but I wish you had not
wakened me up. I was having such a nice nap." 
 "Have you got it?" asked the shark. "It is time we were going." 
 "Going  where ?" inquired the monkey. 
 "Why, to my country, of course, with your heart. You  can't  have
forgotten!" 
 "My dear friend," answered the monkey, with a chuckle, "I think you
must be going a little mad. Do you take me for a washerman's donkey?" 
 "Don't talk nonsense," exclaimed the shark, who did not like being
laughed at. "What do you mean about a washerman's donkey? And I wish you
would be quick, or we may be too late to save the sultan." 
 "Did you  really  never hear of the washerman's donkey?" asked the
monkey, who was enjoying himself immensely. "Why, he is the beast who has
no heart. And as I am not feeling very well, and am afraid to start while
the sun is so high lest I should get a sunstroke, if you like, I will come
a little nearer and tell you his story." 
 "Very well," said the shark sulkily, "if you won't come, I suppose I
may as well listen to that as do nothing." 
 So the monkey began. 
 
A washerman once lived in the great forest on the other side of the town,
and he had a donkey to keep him company and to carry him wherever he
wanted to go. For a time they got on very well, but by and by the donkey
grew lazy and ungrateful for her master's kindness, and ran away several
miles into the heart of the forest, where she did nothing but eat and eat
and eat, till she grew so fat she could hardly move.
 One day as she was tasting quite a new kind of grass and wondering if
it was as good as what she had had for dinner the day before, a hare
happened to pass by. 
 "Well, that  is  a fat creature," thought she, and turned out of
her path to tell the news to a lion who was a friend of hers. Now the lion
had been very ill and was not strong enough to go hunting for himself, and
when the hare came and told him that a very fat donkey was to be found
only a few hundred yards off, tears of disappointment and weakness filled
his eyes.
 "What is the good of telling me that?" he asked in a weepy voice. "You
know I cannot even walk as far as that palm."
 "Never mind," answered the hare briskly. "If you can't go to your
dinner, your dinner shall come to you," and nodding a farewell to the lion
she went back to the donkey.
 "Good morning," said she, bowing politely to the donkey, who lifted her
head in surprise. "Excuse my interrupting you, but I have come on very
important business."
 "Indeed," answered the donkey, "it is most kind of you to take the
trouble. May I inquire what the business is?"
 "Certainly," replied the hare. "It is my friend the lion who has heard
so much of your charms and good qualities that he has sent me to beg that
you will give him your paw in marriage. He regrets deeply  that he is
unable to make the request in person, but he has been ill and is too weak
to move."
 "Poor fellow! How sad!" said the donkey. "But you must tell him that I
feel honored by his proposal and will gladly consent to be Queen of the
Beasts."
 "Will you not come and tell him so yourself?" asked the hare.
 Side by side they went down the road which led to the lion's house. It
took a long while, for the donkey was so fat with eating she could only
walk very slowly, and the hare, who could have run the distance in about
five minutes, was obliged to creep along till she almost dropped with
fatigue at not being able to go at her own pace.
 When at last they arrived the lion was sitting up at the entrance,
looking very pale and thin. The donkey suddenly grew shy and hung her
head, but the lion put on his best manners and invited both his visitors
to come in and make themselves comfortable.
 Very soon the hare go up and said, "Well, as I have another engagement
I will leave you to make acquaintance with your future husband," and
winking at the lion she bounded away.
 The donkey expected that as soon as they were left alone the lion would
begin to speak of their marriage, and where they should live, but as he
said nothing she looked up.
 To her surprise and terror she saw him crouching in the corner, his
eyes glaring with a red light, and with a loud roar he sprang towards her.
But in that moment the donkey had had time to prepare herself, and jumping
on one side dealt the lion such a hard kick that he shrieked with the
pain. Again and again he struck at her with his claws, but the donkey
could bite too, as well as the lion, who was very weak after his illness,
and at last a well planted kick knocked him right over, and he rolled on
the floor, groaning with pain.
 The donkey did not wait for him to get up, but ran away as fast as she
could and was lost in the forest.
 Now the hare, who knew quite well what would happen, had not gone to do
her business, but hid herself in some bushes behind the cave,  where she
could hear quite clearly the sounds of the battle. When all was quiet
again she crept gently out, and stole round the corner.
 "Well, lion, have you killed her?" asked she, running swiftly up the
path.
 "Killed her, indeed!" answered the lion sulkily, "it is she who has
nearly killed me. I never knew a donkey could kick like that, though I
took care she should carry away the marks of my claws."
 "Dear me! Fancy such a great fat creature being able to fight!" cried
the hare. "But don't vex yourself. Just lie still, and your wounds will
soon heal," and she bade her friend good-bye, and returned to her family.
 Two or three weeks passed, and only bare places on the donkey's back
showed where the lion's claws had been, while, on his side, the lion had
recovered from his illness and was now as strong as ever. He was beginning
to think that it was almost time for him to begin hunting again, when one
morning a rustle was heard in the creepers outside, and the hare's head
peeped through.
 "Ah! there is no need to ask how you are," she said. "Still you mustn't
overtire yourself, you know. Shall  I  go and bring you your dinner?"
 "If you will bring me that donkey I will tear it in two," cried the
lion savagely, and the hare laughed and nodded and went on her errand.
 This time the donkey was much further than before, and it took longer
to find her. At last the hare caught sight of four hoofs in the air, and
ran towards them. The donkey was lying on a soft cool bed of moss near a
stream, rolling herself backwards and forwards from pleasure.
 "Good morning," said the hare politely, and the donkey got slowly onto
her legs, and looked to see who her visitor could be.
 "Oh, it is  you , is it?" she exclaimed. "Come and have a chat.
What news have you got?"
 "I mustn't stay," answered the hare; "but I promised the lion to beg
you to pay him a visit, as he is not well enough to call on you."
 "Well, I don't know," replied the donkey gloomily. "The last time we
went he scratched me very badly, and really I was quite afraid."
 "He was only trying to kiss you," said the hare, "and you bit him, and
of course that made him cross."
 "If I were sure of  that ," hesitated the donkey.
 "Oh, you may be quite sure," laughed the hare. "I have a large
acquaintance among lions. But let us be quick," and rather unwillingly the
donkey set out.
 The lion saw them coming and hid himself behind a large tree. As the
donkey went past, followed by the hare, he sprang out, and with one blow
of his paw stretched the poor foolish creature dead before him.
 "Take this meat and skin it and roast it," he said to the hare; "but my
appetite is not so good as it was, and the only part I want for myself is
the heart. The rest you can either eat yourself or give away to your
friends."
 "Thank you," replied the hare, balancing the donkey on her back as well
as she was able, and though the legs trailed along the ground she managed
to drag it to an open space some distance off, where she made a fire and
roasted it.
 As soon as it was cooked, the hare took out the heart and had just
finished eating it when the lion, who was tired of waiting, came up.
 "I am hungry," said he. "Bring me the creature's heart. It is just what
I want for supper."
 "But there is no heart," answered the hare, looking up at the lion with
a puzzled face.
 "What nonsense!" said the lion. "As if every beast had not got a heart.
What do you mean?"
 "This is a washerman's donkey," replied the hare gravely.
 "Well, and suppose it is?"
 "Oh, fie!" exclaimed the fare. "You, a lion and a grown-up person, and
ask questions like that. If the donkey had had a heart would she be here
now? The first time she came she knew you were trying to kill her, and ran
away. Yet she came back a second time. Well, if she had had a heart would
she have come back a second time? Now  would  she?"
 And the lion answered slowly, "No, she would not."
 
 "So you think I am a washerman's donkey?" said the monkey to the shark,
when the story was ended. "You are wrong. I am not. And as the sun is
getting low in the sky, it is time for you to begin your homeward journey.
You will have a nice cool voyage, and I hope you will find the sultan
better. Farewell!" 
 And the monkey disappeared among the green branches, and was gone.
