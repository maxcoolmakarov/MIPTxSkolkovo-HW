Dr. Abraham Van der Meer, an upright and zealous reformer, relates in his memorabilia, that his grandmother, while residing at the Hague, being one summer night unable to sleep, placed herself, about four o'clock in the morning, at the window, and there saw a coffin coming up the Spui Straat, but without anyone else seeming to notice it. It moved on until it stood up erect before a house, where it vanished in an open window.  
Before six weeks had expired every inmate of that house had died of the plague.
