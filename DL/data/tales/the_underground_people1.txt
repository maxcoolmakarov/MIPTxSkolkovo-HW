On a farm at Dankmarkshausen the horses were dying, one after another, and no one knew why.  
Then it happened that late one evening the owner was walking across the kitchen floor when he saw a faint light and heard soft voices coming from beneath an upside-down tub. He saw that four underground people were there, kneading dough that had been left out overnight to rise.  
One said to the others: "Knead away; knead away."  
Seeing that they had been discovered, they did not flee, but instead addressed the farmer who was observing the little men with amazement: "Since you are here, we want to tell you why your horses are dying. We live beneath your stall, and we cannot stand your animals. Put them someplace else, and they no longer will be harmed."  
The farmer did what they told him to do, and from that time onward none of his horses died.  
 
There is an excellent horse stall at the castle in Gerstungen. But no horses can be held there, not even if they are tied up with double chains. Horses brought inside tear everything apart. They foam, go crazy, and kick about until they are taken out.  
It is said that underground people live beneath the stall, and that the horses hate them as much as they hate the horses.
