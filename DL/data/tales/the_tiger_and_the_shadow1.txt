There was a saltlick in the jungle to which all the beasts of the 
forest resorted, but they were greatly afraid by reason of an 
old tiger which killed one of them every day. At length, therefore, Plando 
the mouse-deer said to the tiger, "Why not permit me 
to bring you a beast every day, to save you from hunting for your food?" 
 
 The tiger consented, and Plando went off to make arrangement with the 
beasts. But he could not persuade any of them to 
go, and after three days he set off, taking nobody with him but Kuwis the 
smallest of the flying squirrels.  
 On their arrival Plando said to the tiger, "I could not bring you any 
of the other beasts because the way was blocked by a 
fat old tiger with a flying squirrel sitting astride its muzzle."  
 On hearing this the tiger exclaimed, "Let us go and find it and drive 
it away."  
 The three therefore set out, the flying squirrel perched upon the 
tiger's muzzle and the mouse-deer sitting astride upon its 
hind quarters.  
 On reaching the river, the mouse-deer pointed to the tiger's likeness 
in the water and exclaimed, "Look there! That is the fat 
old tiger that I saw."  
 On hearing this, the tiger sprang into the river to attack his own 
shadow [reflection], and was drowned immediately.
