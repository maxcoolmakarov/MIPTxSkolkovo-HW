One day the Hodja said, "There is no difference between youth and old age."  
Someone asked him, "How so?"  
He answered, "In front of our door there is a stone so heavy that only a few people are able to lift it.  In my youth I attempted to do so, but was unable to. Later, now that I am an old man, I remembered this, and attempted once again, but was still unable to lift it. This experience is why I say that there is no difference between youth and old age."
