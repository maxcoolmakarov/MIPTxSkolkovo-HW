Castles remarkable for size, strength, and antiquity are, by the common 
people, commonly attributed to the Picts, or Pechs, who are not supposed 
to have trusted solely to their skill in masonry in constructing these 
edifices, but are believed to have bathed the foundation-stone with human 
blood, in order to propitiate the spirit of the soil. Similar to this is 
the Gaelic tradition, according to which St. Columba is supposed to have 
been forced to bury St. Oran alive beneath the foundation of his 
monastery, in order to propitiate the spirits of the soil, who demolished 
by night what was built during the day.
