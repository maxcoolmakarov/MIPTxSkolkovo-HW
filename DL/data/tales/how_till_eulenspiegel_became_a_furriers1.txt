Apprentice 
 
It was mid winter when Till Eulenspiegel arrived at Ascherleben.  Times
were hard, but finally he found a furrier who was willing to take on an
apprentice, and he was put to work sewing pelts.  Not being accustomed to
the smell of the curing hides, he said, "Pew!  Pew!  You are as white as
chalk, but stink like dung!" 
The furrier said, "If you don't like the smell, then why are you a
furrier's apprentice?  It's a natural smell.  It's only wool." 
Eulenspiegel said nothing, but thought, "One bad thing can drive another
bad thing away."  Then he let such a sour fart that the furrier and his
wife had to stop working. 
The furrier said, "If you have to fart like that, then go out into the
courtyard.  There you can fart as much as you like." 
Eulenspiegel answered, "A fart is more natural and healthier than the
stench of your sheep pelts." 
The furrier said, "Healthy or not, if you want to fart, then go
outside." 
Eulenspiegel said, "Master, it would do no good, because farts don't like
the cold.  They are used to being in a warm place.  That's why if you let
a fart it always rushes for your nose.  It goes from one warm place to
another." 
The furrier said nothing, for he could see that Eulenspiegel knew nothing
of the furrier trade and was a rogue at that.  And he sent him on his
way.
