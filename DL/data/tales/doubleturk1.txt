Once a prominent dwarf fell in love with a beautiful girl and wanted to
force her to marry him. To be sure, the girl had a great aversion toward
him because he was so small and not at all good looking, and she would not
agree to marry him. However, he won over her father by offering him much
money and land, so she finally had to accept his proposal. Nevertheless,
he agreed to release her from her promise and to leave her alone if she
could succeed in discovering his name. The girl searched a long time, but
to no avail. However, in the end fate came to her aid.  
 One night a fish dealer was traveling along the road to Greifswald.
Coming to a place where he saw a large number of dwarfs joyfully dancing
and jumping about in the moonlight, he stopped with amazement. Then he
suddenly heard one of the dwarfs call out with joy, "If my bride knew that
my name is Doubleturk, she wouldn't take me!" 
 The next day the fish dealer related this experience in a tavern in
Greifswald. The bride heard about it from the tavern keeper's daughter.
She immediately assumed that it had been her lover, and when he came to
her, she called him Doubleturk. Then the dwarf disappeared in great anger,
and that was the end of their courtship.
