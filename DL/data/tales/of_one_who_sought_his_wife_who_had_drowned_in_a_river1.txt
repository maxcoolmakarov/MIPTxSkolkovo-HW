Another man, whose wife had drowned in a river, sought her corpse against the stream. When someone wondered about this and recommended to him that he search downstream, the man said, "There is no way that she would be found downstream. When she was alive she was so contradictory and self-willed that she was against everything that anyone said or did. In death, as well, she would have only gone against the stream."
