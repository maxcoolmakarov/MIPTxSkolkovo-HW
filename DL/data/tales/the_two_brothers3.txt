Once upon a time there were two brothers. Each of them possessed ten 
loaves of bread; and they said, "Let us go and seek our fortune." So they 
arose and went forth.   
When they had gone a little way they were hungry. One brother said to the 
other, "Come, let us eat thy bread first, then we can eat mine." And he 
agreed, and they took of his loaves and did eat, and they afterwards went 
on their way.   
And they travelled for some time in this manner. At last, when these ten 
loaves were finished, the brother who had first spoken said, "Now, my 
brother, thou canst go thy way and I shall go mine. Thou hast no loaves 
left, and I will not let thee eat my bread." So saying, he left him to 
continue his journey alone.   
He went on and on, and came to a mill in a thick forest. He saw the miller 
and said, "For the love of God, let me stay here tonight."   
The miller answered, "Brother, it is a very terrible thing to be here at 
night; as thou seest, even I go elsewhere. Presently wild beasts will 
assemble in the wood, and probably come here."   
"Have no fear for me; I shall stay here. The beasts cannot kill me," 
answered the boy.   
The miller tried to persuade him not to endanger his life, but when he 
found his arguments were of no avail he rose and went home. The boy crept 
inside the hopper of the mill.   
There appeared, from no one knows where, a big bear; he was followed by a 
wolf, then a jackal; and they all made a great noise in the mill. They 
leaped and bounded just as if they were having a dance. He was terrified, 
and, trembling from fear, he lay down, quaking all over, in the hopper. 
  
At last the bear said, "Come, let each of us tell something he has seen or 
heard."   
"We shall tell our tales, but you must begin," cried his companions.   
The bear said, "Well, on a hill that I know dwells a mouse. This mouse has 
a great heap of money, which it spreads out when the sun shines. If anyone 
knew of this mouse's hole, and went there on a sunny day, when the money 
is spread out, and struck the mouse with a twig, and killed it, he would 
become possessed of great wealth."   
"That is not wonderful!" said the wolf. "I know a certain town where there 
is no water, and every mouthful has to be carried a great distance, and an 
enormous price is paid for it! The inhabitants do not know that in the 
center of their town, under a certain stone, is beautiful, pure water. 
Now, if any one knew of this, and would roll away that stone, he would 
obtain great wealth."   
"That is nothing," said the jackal. "I know of a king who has one only 
daughter, and she has been an invalid for three years. Quite a simple 
remedy would cure her: if she were bathed in a bath of beech leaves she 
would be healed. You have no idea what a fortune any one would get if he 
only knew this."   
When they had spoken thus, day began to dawn. The bear, the wolf, and the 
jackal went away into the wood. The boy came out of the hopper, gave 
thanks to God, and went to the mouse's hole, of which the bear had spoken. 
  
He arrived, and saw that the story was true. There was the mouse with the 
money spread out. He stole up noiselessly, and, taking twigs in his hand, 
he struck the mouse until he had killed it, and then gathered up the 
money. Then he went to the waterless town, rolled away the stone, and 
behold! streams of water flowed forth. He received a reward for this, and 
set out for the kingdom of which the jackal had spoken.   
He arrived, and enquired of the king, "What wilt thou give me if I cure 
thy daughter?"   
The king replied, "If thou canst do this I will give thee my daughter to 
wife."   
The youth prepared the remedy, made the princess bathe in it, and she was 
cured. The king rejoiced greatly, gave him the maiden in marriage, and 
appointed him heir to the kingdom.   
This story reached the ears of the youth's brother. He went on and on, and 
it came to pass that he found his brother. He asked him, "How and by what 
cunning has this happened?"   
The fortunate youth told him all in detail.   
"I also shall go and stay at that mill a night or two."   
His brother used many entreaties to dissuade him, and when he would not 
listen, said, "Well, go if thou wilt, but I warn thee again it is very 
dangerous."   
However, he would not be persuaded, and went away. He crept into the 
hopper, and was there all night.   
From some place or other arrived the former guests -- the bear, the wolf, 
and the jackal.   
The bear said, "That day when I told you my story the mouse was killed, 
and the money all taken away."   
The wolf said, "And the stone was rolled away in the waterless town of 
which I spoke."   
"And the king's daughter was cured," added the jackal.   
"Then perhaps someone was listening when we talked here," said the bear. 
"Perhaps someone is here now," shrieked his companions.   
"Then let us go and look; certainly no one shall listen again," said the 
three; and they looked in all the corners. They sought and sought 
everywhere. At last the bear looked into the hopper, and saw the trembling 
boy. He dragged him out and tore him to pieces.
