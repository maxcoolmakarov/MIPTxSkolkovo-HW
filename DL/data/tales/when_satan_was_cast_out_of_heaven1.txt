Know that when Satan was cast out of heaven, on account of his pride, 
and fell to the earth, there were other spirits, which, like him, were 
also cast out. These spirits, in their fall, were borne hither and thither 
on the winds like the golden leaves in the autumn storm, falling to earth 
finally, some into the sea, some into the forests, and some upon the 
mountains. Where they fell there they remained, so the saying runs, and 
found there their field of action. After their abiding places they were 
given different names. Thus we have sea nymphs, mountain fairies, wood 
fairies, elves, and other spirits, all of which are described in the 
catechism.
