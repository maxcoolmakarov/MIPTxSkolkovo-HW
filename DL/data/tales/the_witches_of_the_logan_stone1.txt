Who that has traveled into Cornwall but has visited the Logan Stone?  
Numerous Logan rocks exist on the granite hills of the county, but that 
remarkable mass which is poised on the cubical masses forming its 
Cyclopean support, at Trereen, is beyond all others "The Logan Stone." 
A more sublime spot could not have been chosen by the Bardic priesthood 
for any ordeal connected with their worship; and even admitting that 
nature may have disposed the huge mass to wear away, so as to rest 
delicately poised on a pivot, it is highly probable that the wild worship 
of the untrained tribes, who had passed to those islands from the shores 
of the Mediterranean Sea, may have led them to believe that some 
superhuman power belonged to such a strangely balanced mass of rock. 
Nothing can be more certain than that through all time, passing on from 
father to son, there has been a wild reverence of this mass of rock; and 
long after the days when the Druid ceased to be there is every reason for 
believing that the Christian priests, if they did not encourage, did not 
forbid, the use of this and similar rocks to be used as places of ordeal 
by the uneducated and superstitious people around. 
Hence the mass of rock on which is poised the Logan Stone has ever been 
connected with the supernatural.  To the south of the Logan Rock is a 
high peak of granite, towering above the other rocks; this is known as 
the Castle Peak. 
No one can say for how long a period, but most certainly for ages, this 
peak has been the midnight rendezvous for witches.  Many a man, and woman 
too, now sleeping quietly in the churchyard of St. Levan, would, had they 
the power, attest to have seen the witches flying into the Castle Peak on 
moonlight nights mounted on the stems of the ragwort ( Senécio 
Jacobæa Linn. ), and bringing with them the things necessary to 
make their charms potent and strong. 
This place was long noted as the gathering place of the army of witches 
who took their departure for Wales, where they would luxuriate at the 
most favored seasons of the year upon the milk of the Welshmen's cows.  
From this peak many a struggling ship has been watched by a malignant 
crone, while she has been brewing the tempest to destroy it; and many a 
rejoicing chorus has been echoed, in horror, by the cliffs around, when 
the witches have been croaking their miserable delight over the perishing 
crews, as they have watched man, woman, and child drowning, whom they 
were presently to rob of the treasures they were bringing home from other 
lands. 
Upon the rocks behind the Logan Rock it would appear that every kind of 
mischief which can befall man or beast was once brewed by the St. Levan 
witches.
