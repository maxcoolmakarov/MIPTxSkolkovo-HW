A dwarf once asked for work at the flour mill in Ems. He promised to serve well, even for a small wage, and the miller hired him. The dwarf faithfully kept his word. He worked in the mill from the first cock-crow until late in the evening. He even got up in the night to check on the mill's moving parts.  
The mill clattered busily away, grinding twice as much grain as usual.  
Approaching the year's end the miller wanted to give the dwarf a nice present to show his appreciation for his good service. Because the dwarf was dressed in tattered rags, the miller had a beautiful suit of clothes tailored for him from the finest sheep's wool and the color of flour. When he handed the new clothes to the dwarf, the latter hopped away and disappeared into the mill. There he tore off his old rags and threw them into the mill-stream, put on the new clothes, then looked at himself with pleasure, saying: 

 
 
 
  
Jetzt bin ich ein schöner Mann, 
Daß ich nicht mehr mehlen kann!  
 
 
Now what a handsome man am I,    
So to this mill I say "good-bye!"  
 
 
 
 

No longer willing to work in the dusty mill, the dwarf went forth into the wide world without taking leave from his master. The miller hurried after him, but could find him nowhere.
