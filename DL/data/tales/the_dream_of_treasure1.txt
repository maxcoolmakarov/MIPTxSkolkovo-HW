On the Tyrolean border near Wopnitz there lived a peasant from Krain whose name was Japnig. His domestic situation had fallen to the point that he feared his few remaining goods would be confiscated by the authorities.   
One night he dreamed he should go to Stall in the MÃ¶ll Valley, and, according to the dream, he would find a treasure on his way there.  Japnig found this dream very striking, so he set forth immediately.  Underway he met an old invalid on a bridge, who, as is customary asked him how far he was going.   
"To Stall," answered the peasant, then added, "And you?"   
"I don't know" answered the invalid, "I have neither home nor money."   
This all-too-frequent topic of conversation gave the two common ground, and they complained to one another about their hard times.  Finally the peasant told the old soldier about his dream.    
The latter laughed into his face and said, "Anyone can dream about treasure.  I myself have dreamed three times that there was a treasure in the hearth of someone named Japnig, or was it Havenot -- have you ever heard such a horrible name?  What good is this to me?  Do I even know if such a fellow exists?  Dreams are foam."   
Japnig was right startled to hear his name.  He became still as a mouse, then said farewell to the soldier.   
He did not go to Stall, but after a small detour returned immediately to his home in Wopnitz, where he forthwith began to tear apart his hearth.  His wife thought that he had gone mad, but mortared into the hearth he found a pot filled with thalers, which solved all of Japnig's difficulties.   
According to another legend, Japnig walked all the way to the bridge at Prague where he met the old soldier.  That would have been a great distance, but this frequently told legend always features a bridge, with the favorites being at Innsbruck, Regensburg, or Prague.
