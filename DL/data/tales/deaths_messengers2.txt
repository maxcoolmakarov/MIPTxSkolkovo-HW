Wendunmuth 
It is said that once a large, powerful giant overcame Death. He struck him down and left him lying on the ground unconscious and powerless. A young man came by and mercifully helped the defeated one recover his former health and strength.  
Death thanked the young man by promising that although God and nature dictated that all men must die, Death would not take him without giving him advanced notice. The young man, because of this promise, felt secure and proud. He ate and drank in excess and led a sinful life. With time he was plagued with any number of ailments.  
Then Death approached him, telling him that his hour of departure had arrived.  
The man did not accept this fate and accused Death of failing to keep his promise, as he had sent no messengers to forewarn him.  
"Hey! Be still!" answered Death. "Have you not received any number of messengers? Some years ago you were plagued with severe fever and soon afterward an even worse one. Now your head is dizzy; your chest suffers from coughing and wheezing; your belly aches with great pain; your arms and legs have lost their strength; your skin has become withered and wrinkly. You should have been reminded of all those things by my dear brother sleep, in whose bands you have so often lain as if you were dead. Therefore your excuses are nothing. I shall take you with me."
