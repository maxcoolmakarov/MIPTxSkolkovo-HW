It would be extremely difficult to class this  supernatural  agent, who holds a distinguished place in the Irish " Faerie ." His appearance, however, is supposed to be that of a shrivelled little old man, whose presence marks a spot where hidden treasures lie concealed, which were buried there in " the troubles ."  
He is, therefore, generally seen in lone and dismal places, out of the common haunts of man; and though the night-wanderer may endeavour to mark the place where he beheld the guardian of the treasures perched, yet when he returns in the morning with proper implements to turn up the earth, the thistle, stone, or branch, he had placed as a mark, is so multiplied, that it is no longer a distinction, and the disappointments occasioned by the malignity of the little  Lepreghaun  render him a very unpopular fairy. His name is never applied but as a term of contempt.
