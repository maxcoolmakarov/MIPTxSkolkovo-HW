A hen was standing under a hazel-tree one day, and a nut fell on her tail. Away she ran to the cock, and says she, "Cocky Locky, the end of the world is come."   
"How do you know, Henny Penny?" says he.   
"Oh, a nut fell on my tail just now."   
"If that be so, we have nothing for it but to run away."   
So they ran till they met the duck. "Oh, Ducky Lucky, the end of the world is come."   
"How do you know, Cocky Locky?"   
"Oh, a nut fell just now on Henny Penny's tail."   
"If that be so, we must run for it."   
When they were pegging off, they met the goose. "Oh, Goosey Poosey, the end of the world is come."   
"How do you know, Ducky Lucky?"   
"A nut fell on Henny Penny's tail just now."   
"If that be the case, we are done for."   
They met the fox. "Oh, Foxy Coxy, the world is come to an end."   
"How do you know that, Goosey Poosey?"   
"Oh, a nut fell on Henny Penny's tail."   
"Then let us be off."   
So they got into the wood, and says Foxy Coxy, "Let me count if all are safe. I, Foxy Coxy, one; you, Goosey Poosey, two; Ducky Lucky, three; Cocky Locky, four; Henny Penny, five. Number five, I'll put you in a safe place where the end of the world won't hurt you."   
So he took Henny Penny behind a hush and put her out of pain. "Now," says he, coming back, "let us count if all the rest are safe. I, Foxy Coxy, one; you, Goosey Poosey, two; etc., etc. Number four, I'll put you in a place where you'll be safe when the end of the world comes."   
He took him behind another bush, etc., etc., etc. "Now let me see if all the rest are here. I, Foxy Coxy, one; etc., etc., etc." and so on till he put the fear of the world's end out of every one of them.
