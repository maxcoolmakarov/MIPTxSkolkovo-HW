Have you ever heard of the Morbach Monster?   
I first learned of the legend while I was stationed at Hahn Airforce Base,
Germany.  Morbach was a munitions site just outside of the villiage of
Wittlich.  
Supposedly Wittlich is the last town where a werewolf was killed. There is
a shrine just outside of town where a candle always burns. Legend has it
that if the candle ever goes out the werewolf will return.  
One night a group of security policemen  were on the way to their post at
Morbach, when they noticed that the candle was out at the shrine, and all
joked about the monster.   
Later that night alarms were received from a fence-line sensor.  When the
security policemen investigated the call one of them saw a huge "dog-like"
animal stand up on its back legs, look at him, and jump over the 7 1/2
foot chain-link fence. A military working dog was brought to the area
where the creature was last seen, and the dog went nuts, not wanting
anything to do with tracking the creature.  
This occured around 1988.
 
There have always been "ghost" stories dreamed up by bored security
policemen, but this is one I have heard over and over again. Thought you
might find it interesting.
