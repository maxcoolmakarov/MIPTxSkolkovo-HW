In the Schaumburg region a werewolf is called a böxenwolf. 
Böxenwolves are humans who are in league with the devil and who can
assume
the form of animals by buckling a strap about themselves.  Then they
cunningly
attack and torment other people.  They can be exposed by throwing a piece
of
steel over them.  There is not a single village in which someone has not
been
seized in the back of the neck by a böxenwolf and has had to drag it,
gasping for breath, for some distance.
