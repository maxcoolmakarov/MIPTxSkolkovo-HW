There was in the palace of the world a grocer, and he had a wife, a
beauty of the age, and that woman had a lover. 
 One day this woman's lover said, "If your husband found us out, he
would not leave either of us sound." 
 The woman said, "I am able to manage that I shall make merry with you
before my husband's eyes." 
 The youth said, "Such a thing cannot be." 
 The woman replied, "In such and such a place there is a large tree.
Tomorrow I will go on an outing with my husband to the foot of that tree.
Hide yourself in a secret place near that tree, and when I make a sign to
you, come." 
 As her lover left, her husband arrived. The woman said, "Man, I would
like to go on an outing with you tomorrow to such and such a tree." 
 The man replied, "So be it." 
 When it was morning the woman and her husband went to that tree. The
woman said, "They say that he who eats this sweetmeat sees single things
as though they were double," and she ate some and gave her husband some to
eat. 
 Half an hour afterward the woman climbed up the tree and turned and
looked down and began, "May you be struck blind! May God punish you! Man,
what are you doing? Is there anyone who has ever done such a thing? You
are making merry with a strange woman under the eyes of your wife. Quick,
divorce me!" And she cried out. 
 Her husband said, "What is with you, woman? Have you gone mad? There is
no one with me." 
 Said the woman, "Be silent, you unblushing and shameless fellow. The
woman is with you, and you deny it." 
 Her husband said, "Come down." 
 She replied, "I will not come down so long as that woman is with
you." 
 Her husband began to swear, protesting, and the woman came down and
said to him, "Where is that harlot? Quick, show her to me, or else!" 
 Again the man swore, and the woman said, "Can it then be the work of
the sweetmeat?" 
 The man said, "May be." 
 Said the woman, "You too go up and look down on me, and let us
see." 
 Her husband took hold of the tree, and while he was climbing, the woman
made a sign to her lover. The man looked down and saw the woman making
merry with a youth. 
 This time the man cried out, "Away with you! What is with you, you
shameless boy?" 
 The woman said, "You are lying." 
 But the man could not endure it and began to come down, and the youth
ran off.
