Gesta Romanorum 
 Folliculus, a knight, was fond of hunting and tournaments. He had an
only son, for whom three nurses were provided. Next to this child he loved
his falcon and his greyhound. 
 It happened one day that he was called to a tournament, whither his
wife and domestics went also, leaving the child in the cradle, the
greyhound lying by him, and the falcon on his perch. 
 A serpent that inhabited a hole near the castle, taking advantage of
the profound silence that reigned, crept from his habitation and advanced
towards the cradle to devour the child. The falcon, perceiving the danger,
fluttered with his wings till he awoke the dog, who instantly attacked the
invader, and after a fierce conflict, in which he was sorely wounded,
killed him. He then lay down on the ground to lick and heal his
wounds. 
 When the nurses returned they found the cradle overturned, the child
thrown out, and the ground covered with blood, as well as the dog, who,
they immediately concluded, had killed the child. Terrified at the idea of
meeting the anger of the parents, they determined to escape, but in their
flight fell in with their mistress, to whom they were compelled to relate
the supposed murder of the child by the greyhound. 
 The knight soon arrived to hear the sad story, and, maddened with fury,
rushed forward to the spot. The poor wounded and faithful animal made an
effort to rise, and welcome his master with his accustomed fondness; but
the enraged knight received him on the point of his sword, and he fell
lifeless to the ground. 
 On examination of the cradle the infant was found alive and unhurt, and
the dead serpent lying by him. the knight now perceived what had happened,
lamented bitterly over his faithful dog, and blamed himself for having
depended too hastily on the words of his wife. Abandoning the profession
of arms, he broke his lance in three pieces, and vowed a pilgrimage to the
Holy Land, where he spent the rest of his days in peace.
