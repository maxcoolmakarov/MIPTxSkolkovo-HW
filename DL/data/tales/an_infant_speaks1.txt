Ages ago the cruel custom ruled of entombing infants in the foundations of
castles and fortresses in order to provide protection against storms,
weather, and the dangers of war.  The infants were purchased from their
mothers for large sums of money.  Once a fortified castle was to be thusly
built in the Stargard region.  An infant had already been purchased.
Before committing the cruel deed, the masons who had been engaged for the
construction were talking with one another: "What is sweeter than a
mother's nipple?" 
The answer came to them from the infant's mouth: "The grace of God!" 
Taken aback, the workmen laid down their tools and refused to proceed with
the wicked building. 
The castle was never completed.
