In the times of Agelmund, the King of the Langobards, it happened that
a woman of this tribe gave birth to seven baby boys at one time.  Being
more brutal than wild animals, she threw them all into a fishpond to
escape the shame.  Just then the king rode past the pond, and he saw the
miserable children floating there.   Stopping his horse, he turned them
from one side to the other with the spear he held in his hand.  One of the
children grasped the royal spear firmly with his little hand.  The king
recognized in this event a sign that this child was to become a special
man.  He ordered that he be pulled from the fishpond and turned him over
to a wet nurse for care.
 Because he had pulled him from a fishpond, which in their language was
called a  lama , he named the child Lamissio.  He grew up and became
a valiant hero.  Following the death of Agelmund he became King of the
Langobards.
