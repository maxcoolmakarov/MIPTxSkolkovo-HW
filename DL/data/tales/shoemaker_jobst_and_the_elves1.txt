In Eschwege the people tell about the elves, and especially how they helped poor Shoemaker Jobst in his time of need.  
One evening Shoemaker Jobst was sitting sadly in his workroom. His wife, burdened with sorrow, had fallen asleep next to their poor children. A cricket was chirping in corner by the stove, and the moon cast its pale light through the old, round window panes onto their pale faces.  
Jobst thought, "If only I could fall asleep with you, and then wake up to a carefree life with you poor little ones!"  
Then he prayed to God in heaven and stretched out on his hard bed. Concerns about the next day and new worries kept him awake. 
As midnight approached he thought that he heard light footsteps in his little cottage.  Trip, trap, and a company of elves came inside. They quickly moved to the leather. One of them did the cutting while another one did the stitching. In a short time they had used up all the leather, and beautiful shoes stood there on his workbench. How Jobst now looked forward to the next day. It finally arrived, and when the streets came to life, many people looked in at the shoes. They bought what was there and ordered new shoes as well.  
Jobst bought more leather, and when midnight came the elves returned. They worked busily, and the next morning his workbench was filled with new shoes. Jobst became famous. Everyone wanted to buy from him. Joy and prosperity now came to his household.  
Jobst wanted to make his benefactors happy. He counted the elves and had nice clothes made for them, laying them out in a row for them. How this did please the elves! They immediately put on their new clothes. But with this they became proud and no longer wanted to make shoes, saying to themselves: 
 
Come now and look at me  
Why should I a cobbler be?  
 
Within the hour they disappeared from Jobst's house, never again to return.
