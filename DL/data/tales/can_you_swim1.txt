I [John Ellerthorpe] once heard of a professor who was being ferried across a river by a boatman, who was no scholar.   
So the professor said, "Can you write, my man?"   
"No, sir," said the boatmam.   
"Then you have lost one third of your life," said the professor. "Can you read?" again asked he of the boatman.   
"No," replied the latter, "I can't read."   
"Then you have lost the half of your life," said the professor.   
Now came the boatman's turn. "Can you swim?" said the boatman to the professor.   
"No," was his reply.   
"Then," said the boatman, "you have lost the whole of your life, for the boat is sinking and you'll be drowned."
