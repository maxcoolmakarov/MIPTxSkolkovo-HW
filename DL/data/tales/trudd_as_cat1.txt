For a long time a mill hand had been plagued every night by Trudd. Then
one night, following the advice of an experienced man, he took a sharpened
sabre to bed with him and stayed awake looking for what might come.
Suddenly a cat crept up to the bed, then positioned itself to jump onto
it. It scarcely had its claws on the sideboard of the bedstead when the
mill hand struck with the sabre, cutting off the claws at their roots. In
the same instant the cat disappeared.
 The next morning it was reported that the miller's wife was still in
bed. It was said that during the night she had fallen down the cellar
stairs and badly hurt her hands. In reality, however, all of her fingers
had been cut off.
