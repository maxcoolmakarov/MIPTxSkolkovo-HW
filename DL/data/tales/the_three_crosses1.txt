Near a hill next to the military road in the so-called  Kurrel , on a rise overgrown with trees where a side-road turns off toward Nemden, there are three stone crosses commemorating a bloody event.  
This place formerly belonged to the Holter borderland and was covered with woods for a great distance. At a later time the  Kurrel  took on a sinister reputation.  
Many years ago three Jews are said to have committed a robbery there. Afterward they began quarreling with one another over the loot. One of them left to bring back food and drink, and during his absence the other two plotted to murder him.  This they did, but when they partook of the food that he had brought back, they died of poisoning, for their murdered comrade had had the same plan.
