There were once five men. The one had no eyes, the second had no legs,
the third was dumb, the fourth had no arms, the fifth was naked. 
 The blind man exclaimed, "Eh, lads, I see a bird!" 
 The dumb man said, "I'll shoot it!" 
 The man without legs said, "I'll run after it!" 
 The man without arms said, "I'll pick it up!" 
 And the naked man said, "I'll put it in my pocket!" 
 Chorus of Yorkshire children:  "Eh! That is a
lie!"
