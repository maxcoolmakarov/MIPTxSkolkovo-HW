In Prague they tell about a poor man who dreamed that he would find a great treasure if he would go to the Prague Bridge. He went there and waited on the bridge for a long time, until finally he told a passerby about his dream.  
"Oh!" said the latter.  I too had such a dream. I dreamed that if I were to go the Prater Woods in Vienna, I would find a golden fox that's buried there. I'm not going to travel that far just because of a dream."  
However, the poor man did indeed make the trip, and he found the golden fox.
