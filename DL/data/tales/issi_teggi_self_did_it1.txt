The Estonians call a farm servant who is in charge of barns and grain a 
 row-man . Such a  row-man  was once sitting and molding buttons 
when the devil came up to him, greeted him, and asked, "What are you doing 
there?"   
"I am molding eyes."   
"Eyes? Can you mold me some new ones?"   
"Oh yes, but right now I do not have any at hand."   
"But would you do it for me another time?"   
"I can do that," said the  row-man .   
"When should I come back?"   
"Whenever you want to."   
The next day the devil returned to have eyes molded for himself.   
The  row-man  said, "Do you want large ones or small ones?"   
"Very large ones."   
The man began to melt a large quantity of lead, saying, "I cannot mold for 
you unless you let me tie you down."   
He told him to lie down with his back on a bench, then took some thick, 
strong cords and tied him down securely.   
After the devil was tightly bound, he asked, "What is your name?"   
"My name is  Issi  (self)."   
"That is a good name. I do not know of a better one."   
The lead was now molten. The devil opened his eyes wide, thinking to get 
new ones, and waiting for the cast.  
"I'm pouring now," said the  row-man , then poured the hot lead into 
the devil's eyes.   
The devil jumped up, with the bench on his back, and ran away. He ran past 
some people who were plowing in a field. They asked, "Who did that to 
you?"   
The devil answered, " Issi teggi  (self did it)."   
The people laughed and said, "Self done, self have."  
The devil died of his new eyes, and since then no one has ever seen him 
again.
