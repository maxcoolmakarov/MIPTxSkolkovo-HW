In the neighborhood of the castle of Wynendael, the former palace of the Counts of Flanders, there dwelt a long time ago an aged peasant, who had a son that was entirely devoted to the chase, and instead of plowing and cultivating the fields, was always roaming about the woods and forests. His father had often reproached him for this propensity, but he continued in his old course.
 
When the old peasant at length lay on his deathbed, he had his son called to him, for the purpose of giving him a last Christian exhortation. He came not, but whistling to his dogs, went out into the thicket. 
 
At this the old man was struck with terrific despair, and he cursed his son with the appalling words, "Hunt then forever! Aye forever!" He then turned his head and expired.
 
From that time the unhappy son has wandered restless about the woods. At night he is frequently heard crying, "Jacko! Jacko! Jacko!" and then the whole neighborhood re-echoes with the noise of the huntsman and the baying of dogs.
 
Others say that the huntsman was, by his father's malediction, transformed to a bird of prey, and flies about in that form, following and attacking both men and beasts, and constantly crying, "Jacko! Jacko! Jacko!"
 
In these latter years the old woods about Wynendael have been grubbed up, since which time the huntsman has gone further up.
