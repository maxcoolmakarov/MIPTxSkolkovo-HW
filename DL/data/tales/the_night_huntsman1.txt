In the nighttime one often hears sounds of wild animals and the voice and the horn of a huntsman. This is said to be the night huntsman.  His cries terrify the children.  They can be brought to silence calling out to them, "Be quiet! Can't you hear the night huntsman?"  
This threat is similar to that of the Romans when they said, " Hannibal ad portas!  [Hannibal is at the gates!]  
Similarly, the Germans say, "Be quiet, or Truyd will come!"  
In the old Mark among my fellow countrymen they say, "Shut your mouth, or the Rye-Mother with her long black tits will come and take you away."  
In other places they say, "Be quiet, or the Popanz will come."  
Or: "Knecht Ruprecht will put you into his sack."  
In this manner the Silesians threaten their obstinate little ones with the night huntsman.  Perhaps they believe that this is RÃ¼bezahl's ghost.
