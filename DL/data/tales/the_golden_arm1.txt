There was once a man who traveled the land all over in search of a
wife. He saw young and old, rich and poor, pretty and plain, and could not
meet with one to his mind. At last he found a woman young, fair, and rich,
who possessed the supreme, the crowning glory of having a right arm of
solid gold. He married her at once, and thought no man so fortunate as he
was. They lived happily together, but, though he wished people to think
otherwise, he was fonder of the golden arm than of all his wife's gifts
besides. 
 At last she died. The husband appeared inconsolable. He put on the
blackest black, and pulled the longest face at the funeral. But for all
that he got up in the middle of the night, dug up the body, and cut off
the golden arm. He hurried home to secrete his recovered treasure, and
thought no one would know. 
 The following night he put the golden arm under his pillow, and was
just falling asleep, when the ghost of his dead wife glided into the room.
Stalking up to the bedside it drew the curtain, and looked at him
reproachfully. Pretending not to be afraid, he spoke to the ghost, and
said, "What have you done with your cheeks so red." 
 "All withered and wasted away," replied the ghost, in a hollow
tone. 
 "What have you done with your red rosy lips?" 
 "All withered and wasted away." 
 "What have you done with your golden hair?" 
 "All withered and wasted away." 
 "What have you done with your  golden arm ?" 
 "You have it!"
