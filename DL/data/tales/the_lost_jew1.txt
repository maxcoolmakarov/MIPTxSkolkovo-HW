Eighty-one year old Frau Bandow from FÃ¼nfeichen narrated: 
 Once in my life I saw the lost Jew. One afternoon I was home
alone when a youthful Jewish man entered my house. He wanted neither to
buy nor to sell anything, but with his Jewish accent asked me for a bite
of bread.  
 I said to him, "You won't like our coarse peasant bread," to
which he replied, "I will like it, if the lady would just give me some."
 
 I then asked him, "Have you come a long way?"  
 He answered, "My way is long! I must travel forever throughout
the world!" With that he left, but a short time later he returned and
asked again for a bite of bread.  
 I immediately said to myself, "Today you have seen the lost
Jew," but to make sure I asked the preacher. He listened to my story and
said that he could not prove it, but that the belief was
there. 
 This answer only strengthened the woman's opinion, which was further
verified through an innkeeper's wife from a neighboring village, where the
Jew had stayed overnight. She reported that he had eaten nothing and that
he had not slept. She had prepared a place for him to lie down, but he
paced back and forth in the sitting room the entire night.  
 Even in her old age, the woman who told this story took great pleasure
that she had had the good fortune to have seen the lost Jew.
