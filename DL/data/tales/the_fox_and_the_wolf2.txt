The fox and the wolf were friends. One time they agreed to go hunting. The fox went off in one direction, and so did the wolf in another direction. The fox traveled in a circle, and by and by ran across the wolf. He asked him what luck he had had. The wolf told him that he had met with a dog, and asked the dog why he liked to stay around human beings.   
Said the dog, "I like them because they defend me."   
Then he asked the dog how they defended him.   
Said he, "Look behind that tree!"   
Now, there stood a man with a gun. Then the wolf was terrified, ran off, and forgot about hunting until he met the fox.  
Now, the fox told what luck he had had. He had had good luck. He told the wolf that he found a dead horse; but the horse was lying very near a road, and he was afraid to tackle him alone. He told the wolf, however, that if he would help him carry the horse off, they would have a feast. The wolf agreed, and they went to where the dead horse was. They stopped near by.   
The wolf wouldn't believe the horse was dead. He told the fox to bring him a handful of hair. The fox brought him a handful of hair, and the wolf smelled it.   
Said he, "Yes, he's been dead quite a while."  
So now the wolf and fox consulted how to carry the dead horse away. The wolf allowed the fox to tie his tail to the dead horse's tail, and the fox took hold of his head to pull him off. When the wolf was securely tied to the horse's tail, the fox went over to his place near the head to get hold. Then suddenly he scratched the horse on the nose; and being, in truth, only asleep, the horse woke up, and dashed away, dragging the wolf.   
Then the fox shouted to the wolf, "Hurrah for me, my friend!"   
But the wolf cried in despair, "How can I hurrah, when I'm up in the air?"
