Mount Matter beneath the Matterhorn in Valais is a high glacier from which
the Vispa River flows.  According to popular legend, an imposing city
existed there ages ago.  The Wandering Jew (as many Swiss call the Eternal
Jew) came there once and said: "When I pass this way a second time there
will be nothing but trees and rocks where you now see houses and streets.
And when my path leads me here a third time, there will be nothing but
snow and ice." 
And now nothing can be seen there but snow and ice.
