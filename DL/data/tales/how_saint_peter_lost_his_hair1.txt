Everyone knows that Saint Peter is entirely bald, except for a single
lock of hair in front that falls over his forehead, but most people do not
know the following story that explains how this came to be.
 While he and Christ were traveling together they came to a farmhouse
where the farmwife was just cooking up some large yeast pancakes in
grease.  According to others it was noodles.
 Saint Peter entered the house to beg for some pancakes, while the Lord
waited outside.  The farmwife was a good-hearted woman, and she gave Peter
three pancakes, fresh from the pan.  But Peter was selfish, and in order
to gain an advantage when the pancakes were divided up, he quickly hid one
of them in his cap, then put it on his head.  He pretended that he had
received only two pancakes, one of which he gave to the Lord.
 The pancake under his cap was still hot, and it began to burn Peter
terribly on the head, but he could not do anything about it; he just had
to bear the pain.
 Later, when he took off his cap, he discovered that the hot pancake had
burned into his head a large bald spot, which remained with him as long as
he lived.  Only the lock of hair that had protruded from the front of his
cap was spared.  Thus Saint Peter's bald head has one lock of hair in
front.
