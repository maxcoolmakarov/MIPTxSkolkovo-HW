Lupton, in his "Notable Things," b. i. 59, tells us: "It is certainly and constantly affirmed that on Midsummer Eve there is found, under the root of mugwort, a coal which saves or keeps them safe from the plague, carbuncle, lightning, the quartan ague, and from burning, that bear the same about them: and Mizaldus, the writer hereof, saith, that he doth hear that it is to be found the same day under the root of plantane, which I know to be of truth, for  I have found them  the same day under the root of plantane, which is especially and chiefly to be found at noon."  
In "Natural and Artificial Conclusions," by Thomas Hill, 12mo. Lond. 1650, we have: "The vertue of a rare cole, that is to be found but one houre in the day, and one day in the yeare. "Diverse authors," he adds, "affirm concerning the verity and vertue of this cole;  viz.  that it is onely to be found upon Midsummer Eve, just at noon, under every root of plantine and of mugwort; the effects whereof are wonderful; for whosoever weareth or beareth the same about with them, shall be freed from the plague, fever, ague, and sundry other diseases. And one author especially writeth, and constantly averreth, that he never knew any that used to carry of this marvellous cole about them, who ever were, to his knowledge, sick of the plague, or (indeed) complained of any other maladie."
