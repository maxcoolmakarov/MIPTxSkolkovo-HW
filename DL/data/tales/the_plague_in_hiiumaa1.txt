A foreign ship lay anchored near the island of Hiiumaa. A few peasants rowed out from the shore to bring provisions. As they were returning a small boy jumped into their boat. He was three-feet tall and dressed in a grey jacket, cut in the style of nobility, and with a three-cornered hat like those formerly worn by Swedish peasants in Hiiumaa.  
They threw him into the water, but he quickly reappeared and took his place in the boat. And that is how the plague came to the village of KÃ¤rdla.  
If the plague entered a house and the inhabitants called out the greeting, "God bless you!" then it had no power over them. However, if the plague greeted first, or if the inhabitants delayed their greeting, then they all would die.  
Thus the plage entered a house where everyone was asleep except for an old servant woman who was lying on the stove. The woman saw how the plague struck each person, one after the other, with a staff. A black-and-blue spot emerged from the spot where each one was struck. From this spot the sickness spread across the entire body, which killed the person in a short time.  
When the plague was about to leave, the servant woman called out, "Touch me with your staff as well."  
But the plague replied, "Your name is not recorded with the others."  
Thus she was the only person in the entire household to remain alive.
