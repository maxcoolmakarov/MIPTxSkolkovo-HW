A lion, enfeebled by age and no longer able to procure food for himself by 
force, determined to do so by cunning. 

Betaking himself to a cave, he lay down inside and feigned to be sick; and 
whenever any of the other animals entered 

to inquire after his health, he sprang upon them and devoured them. Many 
lost their lives in this way, till one day a 

fox called at the cave, and, having a suspicion of the truth, addressed 
the lion from outside instead of going in, and 

asked him how he did. He replied that he was in a very bad way. "But," 
said he, "why do you stand outside? Pray come 

in." "I should have done so," answered the fox, "if I hadn't noticed that 
all the footprints point towards the cave 

and none the other way."
