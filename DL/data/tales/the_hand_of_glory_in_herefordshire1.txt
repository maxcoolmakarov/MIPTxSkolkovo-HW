The "hand of glory" was probably once made and used in Herefordshire. A Crasswall woman remembers among her great-uncle's "silly old tales" one of a witch who made a hand of glory, or "dead man's candle," from the hand of a corpse on the gibbet at Crasswall, in order to put a spell on some people who had ducked her in a horsepond.
