In HÃ¼sby near Schleswig there lived an old, stingy woman.  She
offered her farm hands but little to eat, although there was fresh meat
every Sunday.  The household wondered about this, because the old woman
never bought any meat.  
A young farm hand wanted to discover the woman's trick, so one day he hid
himself in the hayloft instead of going to church with the rest of the
household.  Suddenly he noticed how the woman pulled out a wolf strap and
put it around herself.  She immediately became a wolf, ran out into the
field, and soon came back with a sheep.  
"If she can get meat that easily," thought the boy, "then she can be more
generous with us.  As the woman put meat into the pot, she sighed and
said, as
was her custom, "Oh, dear God, if only I were with you!"  
The boy, pretending to be God, answered, "You'll not come to me for all
eternity."  
"Why not, dear God?"  
"Because you put too little into the pot for your people."  
"Then I'll do better."  
"Yes, that's my advice to you."  
From now on she put a much larger piece of meat into the pot.  But the boy
could not remain silent, and in the village he talked about what had
happened.  When on a Sunday morning the woman again turned herself into a
wolf, the people were on guard.  However, no bullet could harm her until
they finally loaded a flintlock with a silver bullet.  From that time to
the end of her life the woman had an open wound that no doctor could heal.
She never again showed herself as a werewolf.
