In an ancient MS. by Llywelyn Sion, of Llangewydd, there is mention of a frightful monster called the Fad Felen, which was seen through the key-hole of Rhos church by Maelgwn Gwynedd, who "died in consequence." This monster was predicted in a poem by Taliesin, as a "strange creature" which should come from the sea marsh, with hair and teeth and eyes like gold.  
The yellow fever plague, which raged in Wales during some five years in the sixth century, is the monster referred to in this legend.
