In Schwarzkosteletz they tell the legend of the wild hunt as follows: At Christmastime the wild huntsman leads his procession through the air at midnight. He is preceded by an old man who warns the people of the the danger. Then comes a woman on a white horse with neither a saddle nor a bridle. On her right side is the wild huntsman, riding on a fiery horse. Behind them are their followers with howling dogs and shouting loudly.   
It is said that a peasant was returning home from town at midnight when he suddenly heard hunting cries behind him. Turning around he saw an old man who shouted to him to be careful. The peasant threw himself down with his face to the ground, and the procession passed him by without incident.   
Another time a tradesman was walking through a forest by night. Suddenly he heard barking dogs and an unusual commotion in the woods. He threw himself down with his face to the ground. Before the procession flew past him he curiously looked up, and from that hour onward he was insane. (O. Hussa)
