In the vicinity of Jarnitz there lived a werewolf who had the ability to 
transform himself into all kinds of different shapes.  This werewolf 
spent the nights stealing sheep from their enclosures, for in those days 
the sheep were kept at night in enclosures in the open fields.  For 
several nights in a row the shepherd, armed with a loaded gun, had kept 
watch for the night robber.  He had already hit the werewolf several 
times, as he had clearly seen, but the bullets seemed to have done him no 
harm, and he had escaped with his booty every time.  Then the shepherd 
loaded his gun with bullets made of inherited silver, which never 
fail.  Thus this time he would be successful. 
Following his custom, the werewolf appeared again that night.  But as he 
was approaching the enclosure, he immediately sensed that this time the 
shepherd might do him in.  Therefore he quickly turned himself into a 
human, walked up to the shepherd, and said to him in a familiar tone, 
"You don't have to shoot me dead!"  That so unsettled the shepherd that 
he lowered his gun, which he had been aiming at the intruder. 
The werewolf never again dared to steel sheep from the Jarnitz enclosures.
