Only one tradition is known regarding the family of Edzell and this [burial] vault; and, as a matter of course, it is fraught with much of the romance incident to the dreamings of a remote age, but it is also told of other families. Divested, however, of its accustomed minuteness, story has failed to preserve the name of the heroine, but it is uniformly affirmed that she was the wife of one of the lairds, was buried in a trance, and so loaded with rich and valuable jewelry that the sexton's avariciousness got excited to the highest pitch.   
Bent on obtaining the treasure at all hazards, he stole under night to her lonely sanctuary, and soon succeeded in putting himself in possession of the whole, except the massive rings which girded her swollen fingers. These he eyed with great admiration, and having failed to gain them by ordinary means, he resolved to amputate the fingers.   
A slight movement of the body, and the faint exclamation of "Alas!" staggered his valour -- the knife dropped from his guilty hand -- he trembled from head to foot, and fell senseless on the cold damp floor, amidst crazy trestles and musty bones!   
Meanwhile, the lady, disentangling herself from her shroud, snatched the glimmering taper in one hand, and, raising her unexpected deliverer with the other, led him forth from the vault.   
Restored to consciousness, he craved mercy on bended knees; and, although the lady assured him of a handsome reward from her husband if he would accompany her to the castle, he begged for leave to flee from his native land; while she, with a heart grateful for the restoration of life, kindly permitted him to retain his sacrilegious spoil, and the greedy sexton was never heard of more!
