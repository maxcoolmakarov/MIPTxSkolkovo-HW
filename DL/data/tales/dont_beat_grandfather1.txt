A rich man used to feed his father with congee [rice gruel] poured out on a potsherd [a piece of broken pottery]. The son of the former, observing this, took it away one day and hid it. The rich man asked his father where it was and began to beat him [for not telling where it was].  
Thereupon the son exclaimed: "Don't beat grandfather, for it was I who took it away and hid it, thinking that when I grow up I might not be able to get another potsherd to feed you with."  
Upon this the rich man was covered with shame, and ever afterwards kept his father in comfort.
