Two playfellows place their clenched fists one on the top of the other; the owner of the uppermost fist is asked, "What have you got there?"   
He replies, "Apple pie," or any other victuals; is told, "Take it off or else I'll knock it off!" and obeys; and so on till the last, when the dialogue runs:  
 
"What have you got there?" --  Ans.  "Roast beef."   
"Where's my part?" --  Ans.  "The cat's got it."   
"Where's the cat?" --  Ans.  "In the wood."   
"Where's the wood?"  Ans.  "The fire's burnt it."   
"Where's the fire?" --  Ans.  "The water's quenched it."   
"Where's the water?" --  Ans.  "The ox has drunk it."   
"Where's the ox?" --  Ans.  "The butcher's killed it."   
"Where's the butcher?" --  Ans.  "Behind the church door cracking nuts.'  
 Both (pretending to throw nutshells at each other) : "You shall have the shells, and I shall have the kernels!"
