In the village of Dodow near Wittenburg there lived an old woman who
possessed a fox strap.  With its help she could transform herself into a
fox, and thus her table never lacked for geese, ducks, and all kinds of
poultry. 
Her grandchild knew about it, and one day when the schoolmaster was
talking about magic in the school, the child told about the fox strap, and
the next day brought it to school. 
The schoolmaster took it into his hand and unintentionally approached his
head with it.  Suddenly he was standing before the children, transformed
into a fox.  They broke out with a deafening noise.  This so frightened
the little schoolmaster that he jumped out the window with a single
leap. 
He ran to the hill that lay near the village and there built himself a
den. 
One day a great hunt was organized, and our fox was among those pursued by
the huntsmen.  A bullet hit him, and suddenly a schoolmaster was lying
there before the bewildered huntsman.  The bullet had struck the fox strap
and ripped it apart. 
In memory of this event the people of Dodow gave the name Fox Hill to the
place where their schoolmaster had lived.
