The advance of science during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries
slowly but
surely eroded the popular belief that malformed and retarded children
likely
were not human at all, but rather the offspring of some demonic being,
offspring
that could be neglected, abused, and even put to death with no moral
compunctions.  As these theological explanations for retardation gave way
to
medical explanations, community values and personal attitudes changed to
such an
extent that the very word "changeling," its synonym "killcrop," and their
equivalents in other languages now have become historical curiosities,
survivals
of beliefs and practices that helped our northern European forebears --
for good
or for bad -- face the problems of life and death when confronted with
mentally
or physically defective children.
