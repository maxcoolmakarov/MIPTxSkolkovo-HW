A father had turned over his entire fortune to his son, but afterward the son thought nothing about his father's needs.  
The father asked the son to have a coat made for him. Instead, the son gave his father two ells of cloth and told the father to use the cloth to patch his old coat.  
Now the son himself had a three-year old child who came crying to him and said, "Father give me two ells of cloth as well."  
The father gave them to him. Then the child climbed into the attic where he hid the cloth. The father crept after the child to see what he was doing with the cloth.  
He said to the child, "Why did you put the cloth up here?"  
The child said, "I want to keep it until you are old, then I will give it to you to patch your coat with, just as you have done with my grandfather."  
Then the son corrected his ways.
