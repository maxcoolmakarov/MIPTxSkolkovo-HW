The Fairy Faith in Celtic Countries  
A family at Dalby [Isle of Man] had a poor idiot baby, and when it was 
twenty years old it still sat by the fire just like a child.  A tailor 
came to the house to work on a day when all the folks were out cutting 
corn, and the idiot was left with him.  The tailor began to whistle as he 
sat on the table sewing, and the little idiot sitting by the fire said to 
him: "If you'll not tell anybody when they come in, I'll dance that tune 
for you."  
 
So the little fellow began to dance, and he could step it out 
splendidly.  Then he said to the tailor: "If you'll not tell anybody when 
they come in, I'll play the fiddle for you."  And the tailor and the 
idiot spent a very enjoyable afternoon together.  
 
But before the family came in from the fields, the poor idiot, as usual, 
was sitting in a chair by the fire, a big baby who couldn't hardly talk.  
When the mother came in she happened to say to the tailor, "You've a fine 
chap her," referring to the idiot.  
 
"Yes, indeed," said the tailor, "we've had a very fine afternoon 
together; but I think we had better make a good fire and put him on it."  
 
"Oh!" cried the mother, "the poor child could never even walk."  
 
"Ah, but he can dance and play the fiddle, too," replied the tailor.  
 
And the fire was made; but when the idiot saw that they were for putting 
him on it he pulled from his pocket a ball, and this ball went rolling on 
ahead of him, and he, going after it, was never seen again.
  
After this strange story was finished I asked Mrs. Moore where she had 
heard it, and she said: "I have heard this story ever since I was a 
girl.  I knew the house and family, and so did my mother.  The family's 
name was Cubbon."
