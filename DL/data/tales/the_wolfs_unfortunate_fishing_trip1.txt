The wolf and the fox were traveling together. It was very cold.   
The fox said, "I have a good pelt, but I am still freezing."   
The wolf said, "I have always heard that it is warm where the girls hang 
out. Let's go to the spinning room."   
The fox said, "For all I care."   
So they went there, and the wolf began flirting with the girls, while the 
fox made himself comfortable next to the stove. He had a great appetite 
for something delicious. He crept around here and there, but couldn't 
sniff up anything. So he went outside, intending to take a boat ride. 
Someone was just passing by with a wagonload of herrings. The fox jumped 
onto the wagon, opened a tub, and threw out most of the herrings that were 
in it. Then he jumped down and ate up all the herrings, except for one. 
  
He was about to bite into this last one when the wolf came up and said, 
"What are you eating?"   
The fox said, "Fish. Do you want a taste?"  
He gave the wolf half a herring, and it tasted very good to the wolf. He 
said, "Where did you catch such a fish?"   
The fox answered, "Here in the pond."   
The wolf said, "I would like to catch some."   
The fox said, "Just hang your tail down into the water."   
However, it had turned cold, and the water stung the wolf's tail. After a 
while 
he wanted to pull his tail out, but the fox said, "Test its weight!"   
The wolf said, "I don't notice anything."   
The fox said, "Then it's too soon."   
Some time later he again wanted to pull his tail out, and the fox said, 
"Test its weight!"   
The wolf said, "It seems that something is taking hold of it."   
The fox said, "It's still too soon. Those are only little fish."   
By now the tail was nearly completely frozen into the ice.   
Some time later the wolf once again wanted to pull his tail out, and the 
fox said, "Test its weight!"   
The wolf said, "I seem to have caught a very large fish." His tail was 
completely frozen into the ice.   
The fox said, "Pull!" But however hard he pulled, he couldn't pull it out. 
  
The fox said, "Push with your feet! Push with your feet!" And he went on 
his way.   
The wolf pulled and pulled, and tugged and tugged, until finally he tore 
off his tail. This angered him greatly, and from that time onward he was 
always an enemy of the fox.
